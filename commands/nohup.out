Postronnemu obserwatorowi mogłoby się wydawać, że Warszawa jest już nasycona komercyjnymi nieruchomościami, czyli biurowcami i obiektami handlowymi. Jednak dane zebrane przez CBRE mówią co innego – w dalszym ciągu stolicy przybywa i biurowców i nieruchomości z przeznaczeniem na handel, co pod względem inwestycji komercyjnych czyni Warszawę jedną z najbardziej atrakcyjnych stolic europejskich.

Le nove opere presentate costituiscono alcuni esempi di rappresentazione dello spazio su una superficie bidimensionale che escluda qualunque referente analogico con la realtà. Dove cioè, non venga rappresentata alcuna scena reale. E’ risaputo che buona parte dell’arte moderna abbia rivolto la propria attenzione alla sperimentazione di modalità nuove di rappresentazione della realtà. Ma la realtà o, meglio, l’idea che ci facciamo di essa, dipende da fattori diversi e soprattutto da un concetto di spazio (dovremmo aggiungere, di tempo). Se facciamo mente locale, la storia delle arti visive potrebbe essere interpretata come una storia della rappresentazione dello spazio, sempre più “reale”, al punto tale da assistere alla distruzione dello stesso supporto bidimensionale del piano pittorico, ritenuto insufficiente. C’e chi ha affermato che non esiste un dipinto completamente bidimensionale, volendo in tal modo significare che è sufficiente la presenza di un solo punto o una sola linea disegnati su una tela per trasferire, in chi guarda, delle sensazioni spaziali. In effetti quella linea sta “sopra” o “davanti” lo sfondo, simulando in tal modo una stratificazione, una profondità. Gli studi condotti dagli psicologi della Gestalt agli inizi del Novecento, hanno chiarito come facciamo a interpretare lo spazio visivo. Sono sufficienti alcuni indizi come la sovrapposizione, il gradiente di luminosità o di dimensione, la deformazione di un oggetto visivo.

In November 1989, Kai Wiedenhöfer rushed to Berlin to photograph the fall of the Wall. Like many people, he believed at the time that border walls had had their day. This shattered dream was the impetus for Wiedenhöfer to document the border and separation walls of this world. Kai Wiedenhöfer's internationally acclaimed long-term project CONFRONTIER about the walls of this world is extremely topical. His large-format photographs show the inhumanity, but also the absurdity of these buildings which are a sign of the unsolved problems of our time.

We all search for happiness in different ways – sometimes it’s through big, life-changing events and other times it’s in the everyday moments. It’s easy to get caught up in our own thoughts or expectations of what we think will make us happy, but often times the happiest times are right in front of us.

イエスがこの世に来られたのは神の愛を私達に伝えるためです。“イエスは処刑前から神の子だったという信仰自体” ヨハネによる福音書20:29 イエスはトマスに言われた。｢わたしを見たから信じたのか。見ないのに信じる人は,幸いである。｣ これはイエスが処刑され復活された後に復活を信じる事が出来なかった弟子の一人に言われた言葉です。私達クリスチャンにとって聖書の言葉は糧です。私達が今日こうして生活できるのはイエスが私達の罪のために十字架にかけられたからです。 目に見えるものを信じるのは簡単ですが,目に見えないものを信じるのは簡単な事でしょうか。 I do not know what I am saying, but I believe that Jesus is God’s son. Because, Bible says so. Father, forgive them, for they do not know know what they are doing. Though he loves you and God bless you.

Siitä asti, kun Veeti on osannut kävellä, on meillä ollut tapana käydä silloin tällöin metsäretkillä. Joskus ihan kodin vieressä ja joskus hieman kauempana. Joskus on ollut vain pillimehu eväänä ja joskus otetaan sitten makkaranpaistovärkit mukaan. Vaikka en koskaan ole ollut mikään huippuhyvä leikkijä ja omaan todella köyhän mielikuvituksen, niin metsään lähden aina mielelläni lasten kanssa. Omasta lapsuudestanikin muistan metsässä olemisen. Tosin silloin olin äitini mukana esimerkiksi marja- tai sienimetsässä. Vanhempana metsä tuli tutuksi partioharrastuksen myötä. Jollakin tavalla se on siis aina kuulunut elämään ja sen takia tuntuu luonnolliselta viedä lapsiakin metsään ja luontoon.

Vicki Savard decided to go white water rafting on May 17, 2008, because she was in the mood for an adrenaline rush. But what began as a fun outing at Cheat River Outfitters ended up costing Vicki her life. After she had passed away, Kerry Savard sparked a lawsuit in a West Virginia court, listing the Cheat River Outfitters Inc., the company's president, and three river guides as defendants. Yet on February 8, 2011, the wrongful death case was dismissed without a verdict, due to a lack of personal jurisdiction and a lack of venue. Now, the case has been reopened, since Kerry and his legal representative were ruthless in their fight to gain justice for Vicki's untimely passing. The case is still ongoing, as courts probe into the personal records of the three river raft guides who were partially to blame for Vicki's fall overboard.

The long-awaited Regional Greenhouse Gas House Initiative carbon emissions offsets auction takes place Sept. 25, to great fanfare and under the cover of secrecy.With the registration deadline passed, RGGI officials are proclaiming participation is “robust” but they won’t say who is participating, or even how many participants there are.The few New Hampshire companies who actually need such credits are not saying if they are going to bother to bid at this stage. The state of New Hampshire itself won’t participate in the first auction, preferring to wait until the next one in December. In fact, some experts said – thanks to a declining economy and emissions reductions – power producers won’t need as many of the “allowances” being auctioned off to emit carbon dioxide.Indeed, the price of those allowances on the future market is falling rapidly.This could mean that the price of electricity won’t go up as much as was feared, but the pot of money available for conservation will be smaller than originally hoped.“Everybody is waiting to see what will happen,” said Dick Henry, executive director of the Concord-based Jordan Institute, a non-advocacy environmental organization. “Everyone is feeling each other out. Is there going to be more credit than there is demand? Who knows? It will take two or three cycles in the auction before we get an idea of where the price is going.”Under RGGI, a market-based system is being created in an effort to control carbon dioxide emissions from power producers in 10 northeastern states by capping those emissions at current levels – about 188 million tons a year through 2014. By 2018, that cap is slated to be reduced by 10 percent.Under the initiative, New Hampshire’s annual carbon budget is 8.6 million tons, which translates into 8.6 million allowances that must be auctioned each year, in quarterly auctions.No hurryNew Hampshire lawmakers passed RGGI into law last spring, but the state is still hammering out final rules so it won’t be taking part in the first auction on Sept. 25. Neither will New York, New Jersey and Delaware.But that doesn’t mean that New Hampshire power producers don’t have any interest in the September auction of some 12.5 million allowances. An allowance is an allowance, no matter which state is issuing it.Operators of two gas plants required to obtain RGGI allowances didn’t return phone calls. That leaves the largest producer, Public Service of New Hampshire, whose plants emit some 5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.Thanks to a deal cut in the Legislature, PSNH will actually only need about half as many credits, since they are being given credit for 2.5 million allowances a year for at least the first three years, primarily because the utility converted one of its three coal burners at Schiller Station in Portsmouth to a wood burning-plant. It also is being credited for installing a more efficient turbine at a hydroelectric plant in Berlin.But PSNH – or any utility, for that matter – is not in any desperate hurry to buy up allowances during the first auction. For one, the utilities don’t have to settle up for another three years. In that time, they might be able to come up with other efficiencies to reduce their emissions, or they may be able to buy certified allowance offsets from companies that can show they are doing something to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, either by capturing and recycling landfill gas from a landfill or by planting trees, for instance.And even when PSNH finds out how many allowances it needs, it won’t necessarily have to buy them at an auction. It could obtain them from a broker who bought them at auction.“We don’t have to buy them in September,” said spokesperson Martin Murray. “We have to decide how to best meet our compliance requirements at the lowest price.”Going down?So what will the price of an allowance be at auction, and will that price will go up or down?If you look at the futures market, the price is going down. Like any futures market, brokers who sell futures in RGGI are selling a promise to provide a certain amount of RGGI allowances, counting on the actual price being below what the broker is paying for it.When the Chicago Climate Exchange started selling futures on Aug. 15, they were going for $6 a credit. But on Sept. 4, as the auction approached, the market closed at $4.63.The reason? Demand for electricity is down because of the economy, and emissions in 2007 were about 9 percent below the 188 million cap. They may decrease further in 2008. This of course could drive down the price still further.How low could the price go? The auction itself set a floor, or a “reserve price” of $1.86 per emission credit. If there isn’t enough demand in that auction to buy up the credits, than that reserve price could become the “clearinghouse price,” which is the price that everybody would get the credits for no matter what they actually bid.If this were the case, states would receive a lot less money for conservation than they had hoped for. New Hampshire won’t get any money from the September auction, since it isn’t participating, but if that $1.86 floor is maintained and New Hampshire sold all its credits, the state would receive $16 million a year for conservation — much more than the state has had previously, but much less than the amount anticipated.RGGI officials have said that if they can’t sell enough allowances above the reserve price they might actually retire them, which in effect would lower the cap and drive up prices in the future. (Simply decreasing the cap officially would take at least three years.) But this scenario is a far cry from the concerns of power producers when RGGI was first passed.At the time, business groups, and utilities, were concerned that speculators and environmental groups would squirrel away credits, driving up the price so much that they would have to increase electric rates. Most states passed various safeguards spelling out what to do if the price of an allowance rose above a certain amount. In New Hampshire, the threshold was $6 a credit. The money after that threshold was reached would be rebated back to customers. New Hampshire couldn’t spend more than $50 million in conservation money a year, and at that point the money would be desperately needed for rate relief.But for now it appears likely that $6 threshold won’t be reached.While no one can say what brokers will do, it appears unlikely that environmental groups are going to be buying up and retiring credits in order to lower emissions.Seth Kaplan, vice president of climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, said the whole idea environmentalist would horde allowances could be “best described as a scare tactic.”First, multiple auctions make it hard to really lock up allowances.Second, when the biggest national environmental groups “looked at their entire budget, it was the cost of allowances of one coal plant,” Kaplan said, meaning “the idea that there are millions and millions of dollars out there to buy up allowances and retire them greatly overrates the financial strength of environmental organizations.”Third, he said, it doesn’t make sense to market the allowances, as some groups now do for carbon credits, because while someone might pay to feel good in financing the planting of trees or building windmills, nobody would feel good retiring allowances that power plants might not need anyway.

February 11 marks the 42nd anniversary of the Iranian revolution of 1979, which ousted a despotic monarch and ushered in what many Iranians hoped would be the independence and freedom they had fought to attain for so long.

Concentrated promoter shareholdings have typically been the mandate in Indian companies till date.1 Hence, it is not much of a surprise that the significance of promoters in Indian companies can have large implications from a legal standpoint. However, the traditional ownership structure of Indian companies has undergone a paradigm shift in recent times with private equity funds and institutional investors acquiring substantial stakes in Indian companies which do not have a distinctly identifiable promoter group. There has been a monumental rise in control transactions in Indian markets, akin to those in the US, wherein the investors are in control of the company since they have board seats, control rights and veto rights.

Whilst the school now operates ‘as normal’ (or as normal as possible) the impact of the last two years on pupils and staff is still unfolding as the school operates in a recovery mode for teaching. It is recognised that pupils cannot suddenly catch up on what has been missed over the last two years with the teaching staff doing their very best to help all pupils. Additional recovery funding has been received from government sources and Governors have provided support to the school on how this has been spent. There is still a way to go until we really are operating as normal.

Upholding the spirit of patriotism and sense of duty towards the country, the students and staff of NPS School, Hosur Road, Electronic City, Bangalore celebrated 74th Republic Day on 26th January 2023. The celebration began with march-past by the students of grades 6-9, followed by a welcome speech reminiscing the contributions of our leaders in achieving freedom and framing the constitution. The students brought to life the great leaders they dressed as and quoted their lines eloquently. Studentsâ melodious rendition of âJhanda uncha rahe hamaraâ left everyone humming the tune. The energizing dance performances set to resonant popular patriotic songs aroused allegiance towards our motherland. The school rejoiced in the glory of India and its freedom fighters on the occasion of Republic Day celebration.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced a plan on Tuesday that would allow a vote on a “clean” DHS funding bill that would fully fund Pres. Obama’s unconstitutional amnesties. The plan hinges on a possible deal with Senate Democrats that would require them to allow debate on a separate measure that would defund the president’s 2014 executive amnesties. The move came a day after Senate Democrats, along with Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), blocked debate for the fourth time on the House-passed DHS funding bill, H.R.240.

Vari studi hanno evidenziato come i funghi possano contribuire a normalizzare i livelli glicemici, a ridurre i livelli di colesterolo, ad esplicare un'importante attività antinfiammatoria, antitumorale e addirittura immuno-modulatoria positiva, rafforzando così le difese immunitarie.

Joyce Carol Oates’s wide-ranging essay “Inspiration and Obsession in Life and Literature” [NYR, August 13] contains some powerful poetic interpretation, but begins with a long screed against the “essentialist” Plato, whose “churlish” view of poetry treats inspiration as irrational and demands that poets be “banished from the claustrophobic Republic.” The soundness of this view of Plato (who wrote dialogues, not treatises) is debatable; but Oates got wrong the statement in her closing parenthesis: “In one of the great ironies of history, it was to be Plato’s Socrates who was banished from the state.” She implies that Socrates was executed (in 399 BC) after Plato wrote the Republic, but that dialogue surely came some decades later. This is not of mere antiquarian interest; Plato, the most poetic of all ancient prose stylists, knew rather more than most the costs of utopian thinking.

The Australian Dollar opens this morning again under the 70c mark buying 0.6990. Having moved between a low of 0.6978 and a high of 0.7018 the AUD/USD was unable to hold on as US-China trade negotiations continued which created some nervousness amongst investors. Unfortunately, the 11th round of trade talks between the two ended without a deal and the U.S confirmed a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports. The White House announced raising existing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%. Beijing has already vowed to retaliate with unspecified “countermeasures,” which are likely to include higher tariffs on American goods.

What is MongoDB? MongoDB is a database based on a non-relational document model. Thus, as a so-called NoSQL database (NoSQL = Not-only-SQL), it differs fundamentally from conventional relational databases such as Oracle, MySQL or the Microsoft SQL Server. The name MongoDB is derived from the English word “humongous”, which roughly means “gigantic”. MongoDB was released in 2009 by founder and developer Eliot Horowitz, who stepped down as Chief Technology Officer and from the Board of Directors of MongoDB Inc. in 2020, but is still active as a technical consultant.

The original Latin text dates back to around the 8th-9th centuries although it has been attributed to St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153). It was a particular favorite of those chanting it as part of the Divine Office (the Liturgy of the Hours) in the Middle Ages.

Guests from several local WIs were welcomed at our Garden meeting in June when we were all delighted by Fatima – an oriental belly dancer who explained the origins of the dance with amazing animated facial expressions. Her energetic and accomplished dancing was only eclipsed by her wonderful turn of phrase which was part Liverpudlian, part Ancient Egyptian. Members were inveigled into joining in as various costumed characters in her oriental “cabaret”. It was huge fun and very entertaining. Members were applauded for their success in the Cheshire Show: a 2nd for a floral arrangement for Angela Eccles and a 3rd for jewellery making for Rosalind Jackson and 4 other commendations. Good results for a small WI. We congratulated them as we enjoyed the wonderful supper provided by the Catering Committee.

Use a mid-year diary this summer and beyond to give yourself a fresh start. Running from July 2023 to July 2024, we created mid-year diaries for those who love making summer plans, or may have missed out on a diary in January. There are yearly overviews for 2023 and 2024, plus the monthly and weekly views you love. Each month, set the tone by writing out goals, to-dos, important dates and a wish list of things to see, do or discover. The weekly overview pages have plenty of space to note all of your plans, reminders and to-dos. There's also space at the back to write down important dates like birthdays and holidays. Put your important people on paper with the contact pages at the back, where you can keep track of addresses and phone numbers you may forget. There's also a mix of lined, dotted, grid and plain pages at the back for additional notes. Discover our tips for making summer resolutions with your mid-year diary.

A huge baby swimming underwater in Liverpool city centre. This mural by street artist, Paul Curtis, is potentially the largest street art painting in the centre of Liverpool. Located on the side of The Abbey Road bar on Harrington Street in Liverpool, the mural was painted in May 2021 and took 8 days to complete. It measures 18 metres high and 10 metres wide. The piece was commissioned by Derwent Estates Ltd. The baby is said to represent the re-birth of Liverpool and the new hopes and potential of the future following the Coronavirus lockdowns. The underwater element was to try to create an illusion that the building is a pool tank. It also allowed the use of a rich blue colour to help add bright colour to the piece. The name Ethan is chosen by the artist. At the time of painting, his sister was expecting a baby boy, named Ethan.

The social facility units, which aim to bring the users together with thermal water resources, another natural beauty of the region, were embedded in different elevations and hidden in the land as much as possible. Social facilities involve unity of the green and water with the thermal and freshwater pools and green inner courts. In the thermal pool area, small private cubic rooms were designed inside the thermal water pool area. And the daylight usage was provided in whole area through examining the historical Turkish bath typology. While designing the space setup of these social facility units, being inside and outside of the building was reconsidered and a visual connection between thermal water and freshwater was built.

Im Nirgendwo soll es aber dennoch nicht sein. Wer sich die Umgebung von Stuttgart anschaut, stößt auf kleinere attraktive Städte wie Backnang, die viel Lebensqualität und trotzdem eine gute Anbindung an die Großstadt bieten. Hier lässt es sich nicht nur schön wohnen, sondern auch entspannt arbeiten.

Ожирение и сахарный диабет 2 типа — это два хронических заболевания, которые часто встречаются вместе и усугубляют друг друга. Ожирение способствует развитию инсулинорезистентности, то есть снижению чувствительности тканей к инсулину, гормону, который регулирует уровень сахара в крови. В результате, поджелудочная железа вырабатывает больше инсулина, чтобы поддерживать нормальный глюкозный метаболизм, но со временем это приводит к истощению ее функции и повышению сахара в крови. С другой стороны, сахарный диабет 2 типа увеличивает риск развития осложнений от ожирения, таких как сердечно-сосудистые заболевания, артериальная гипертензия, дислипидемия и неалкогольный стеатогепатит.

Acrylglas-Kunst wirkt entweder aus sich selbst heraus – oder aber man kann auch die Wirkung von Kunst durch eine subtile und durchdachte Präsentation mit dem Material verstärken. Bei Kunst in Form von Bildern und Fotos entscheidet oft die Wahl des Rahmens oder der Präsentation, wie Kunst wirkt. Dabei können Licht-Effekte wirkungsvoll eingesetzt werden, um Kunstwerke in ihrem Ausdruck zu unterstützen. Vor allem aber ist Acrylglas ein ganz wichtiger und zeitgemäßer Faktor, um Bilder und Plakate sowie Fotos auch großformatig besonders zu präsentieren. Dabei ist Acrylglas sowohl für professionelle Künstler wie auch für den privaten Wohnbereich heute das beste Mittel der Wahl, wenn es darum geht, Bilder und Poster bestmöglich zu positionieren. Dabei kann auch eine Kombination mit Lichteffekten und Beleuchtungen gewählt werden. Gerade Acrylglas-Bilder und Rahmen sind perfekt dafür geeignet, durch gezielt eingesetzte innovative Beleuchtung auch einzigartige Effekte in der Präsentation zu bewirken. Besonders eignen sich dafür moderne LED-Beleuchtungssysteme, die eine Vielzahl von Effekten und auch akzentuierte, punktgenaue Beleuchtung möglich machen.

Their single-wall carbon rims are designed to offer exceptional compliance by allowing the rim to twist locally along its own axis, thereby allowing the rim to deflect somewhat around bumps.

Over the course of my venture career, I have advised many founders on how to best build and scale their venture-backed companies. Unfortunately, over the last four months alone, Iâve seen founders make major, avoidable mistakes when executing against their venture strategy. These mistakes are highly damaging and oftentimes can cripple the venture (particularly in an economic downturn). They damage a startupâs ability to gain funding, build products, and work with customers. The startup should be achieving far more success.

I don’t think I’ve ever used up an entire pack of flour tortillas before I had to throw them away, and I hate that kind of waste. But the truth is, they were just a neutral vehicle for a wrap, nothing more, so why would I? I just didn’t think of them as very interesting. Until I made my own. I wish I’d known how easy and quick it was to make them and how much better they were, and I think you’ll feel the same. You can also freeze between sheets of parchment any leftovers after they’ve cooled.

Toujours gourmande, pendant la canicule, je les laisse dans le jardin / cour fermée et elle part manger des trèfles et chasse des vers que j'ai caché ça et là. Elle est courageuse, viens vers moi quand je l'appelle pour se faire "gâter" (elle mange sur mes genoux ou sur mon ventre ). Le mâle devient fou de jalousie et il faut qu'il aille sur ma maman pour faire pareil. Ensuite, dans le jardin, c'est le va et vient sur les briques chaudes et il y a plusieurs plantes à pogona qu'ils vont dévorer. Puis le mâle colle la femelle et pour se montrer encore plus macho il a carrément sauté sur le chat pour bobber et montrer sa valeur, sauf que le chat a eu peur des griffes et s'est sauvé sans tenir rancune. La femelle est plus douce et va parfois dormir avec le chat, entre ses pattes. Je crois qu'ils sont heureux et quand ils veulent rentrer, coco se met à la porte fenêtre et ils rejoignent leur terrarium. Quand je caresse, ils ne ferment plus leurs yeux et quand j'arrête, il frottent leur tête sur ma main. J'ai peur de les perdre surtout la femelle qui a 9 ans. Elle a pondu 2 fois ce printemps et elle souffrait d'abrasion au cou du au mâle excité. Le pansement a fait des miracles avec une pommade anti ulcères (Flammazine). Elle n'a plus de cicatrice et les écailles ont repoussé. Le pansement a aussi joué le rôle d'armure pour protéger son cou du mâle qui s'excitait sur le pansement (pour lui enlever) au lieu de sa peau. Il tient bien pendant une semaine et elle n'a pas essayé de l'enlever ni de se gratter. En tout cas, c'est efficace contre les morsures. Ce ne sont pas de véritables morsures, mais pour se maintenir lors de l'accouplement. Le mâle n'arrive pas à la féconder... Elle a pondu dehors et a creusé une galerie en terre puis on l'a laissé se reposer, calcium et gavage pour retrouver ses forces et son appétit. Elle est toujours alerte et gourmande malgré ses 9 ans. et j'espère qu'elle pourra passer les 10 ans malgré qu'on dit que les femelles meurent à 8 ans. Ils on 2 lampes UV et une IR (pas rouge, mais en céramique et une grotte pour s'abriter et sous le terrarium, une plaque chauffante qui réchauffe un coin sous la grotte. Il n'y a pas de risque de brûlures ou d'électrocution, c'est de l'autre côté du verre. Il sont dans le coin à manger/cuisine et ils ont de la compagnie tout le temps et ne s'ennuient pas. Ils écoutent tout ce qu'on dit, surtout la femelle qui est tres douce. Et dès que j'arrive le matin, elle sort de sa grotte. S'il lui arrive malheur, je serai inconsolable.

We are passionate about polish pottery and having spent as much time in Boleslawiec, Poland as we have shopping, talking with factory owners and working with local businesses, we have come to appreciate every aspect of how this product is created. We have owned and operated Pacific Polish Pottery since 2000. We started off doing private shopping for people in Poland which led to the creation of a simple e-commerce site. This led us to importing and then wholesale. We eventually opened our own brick and mortar store while expanding our e-commerce site to include thousands of products. We absolutely love what we do.

De coördinatie van deze behandeling vindt plaats vanuit het Prinses Máxima Centrum (hierna het Máxima), het kinderoncologisch centrum in Nederland dat gespecialiseerd is in hoogcomplexe zorg en onderzoek naar kinderoncologie. De geïntegreerde ziekenhuis- en poliklinische apotheek van het Máxima is in alle stadia van de behandeling van de patiënt betrokken bij de medicamenteuze behandeling. Denk hierbij aan medicatieverificatie, controle en voor toediening gereed maken van chemotherapie (en ook 95% van alle andere parenterale geneesmiddelen), advisering over doseringen bij bijvoorbeeld nierfunctiestoornissen en interacties, afleveren van geneesmiddelen voor thuis, inclusief ziekenhuisverplaatste zorg, en het geven van juiste en begrijpelijke informatie aan kinderen en hun ouders/verzorgers. Hiermee draagt de apotheek bij aan de optimalisatie van de behandeling van deze kwetsbare patiëntenpopulatie.

Lawmakers voted on the 5 vetoes sent to them by Governor Mills, and they took up a second “Errors and Omissions” bill to correct, add, or remove language from proposals already passed earlier in the session. Of significance in this bill was adding language and funding to the budget to include Maine’s Town Academies in the continuation of the free lunch program, and the removal of some problematic statutory language on new DEP regulations.

Il est important de comprendre les processus impliqués dans la vente de votre ferraille. Premièrement, le transport est le premier facteur à prendre en considération. Si vous mettez au rebut un petit volume prêt de la maison, le transport n’est pas un problème. Toutefois, si vous êtes propriétaire d’une entreprise produisant régulièrement de grandes quantités de ferraille, vous devrez examiner les options qui s’offrent à vous pour le transport de la ferraille. Les meilleures options sont soit de contacter une entreprise de transport de ferraille qui collectera et vendra la ferraille en votre nom, soit de demander au parc à ferraille de la collecter. Traiter directement avec le parc à ferraille est l’option la plus simple et sera plus rentable que de confier la collecte à une entreprise de transport tierce.

En eindelijk is het mooie weer doorgebroken, een goed begin van mijn vakantie! Zes heerlijk, lange weken vrij. En niets is zo lekker dan de dag beginnen met een rondje hardlopen. Vooral in deze omgeving. Toen ik hier voor het eerst een stukje ging hardlopen wist ik niet wat me overkwam. Tussen de weg waarop ik liep en het weiland ernaast zat een klein slootje. Aan de kant van die sloot liepen twee ooievaars. Nog nooit eerder had ik ze van zo dichtbij gezien. Ik liep er denk ik twee meter vanaf en ze bleven gewoon staan. Nu kom ik uit een kleine stad, maar daar had ik nog nooit zoiets gezien. Inmiddels ben ik nu wel wat gewend qua ooievaars. Naast ons huis is een weiland, wanneer alle omringende weilanden al gemaaid zijn, vluchten de muizen en andere kleine dieren naar dit weiland (in het lange gras zijn ze minder zichtbaar voor andere dieren), wat er vorig jaar in resulteerde dat er meer dan 47 ooievaars in dat weiland stonden. Wauw.. Vandaag tijdens het hardlopen kwam ik er weer eentje tegen, ik blijf ze bijzonder vinden en elke keer als ik ze zie moet ik inwendig lachen en besef ik weer in wat voor mooie omgeving ik woon.

Der Telekom-Austria-Syndikatsvertrag zwischen ÖIAG und América Móvil (Foto: ÖIAG-Chef Rudolf Kemler und America Movil CFO Carlos GarciaMoreno) sorgt weiter für Diskussionen. In einem Interview in der Montag erscheinenden profil-Ausgabe üben die Arbeitnehmervertreter im ÖIAG-Aufsichtsrat Helmut Köstinger (Post), Walter Hotz und Werner Luksch (beide Telekom Austria) scharfe Kritik an ÖIAG-Vorstand, Finanzminister und Bundeskanzler. Wir haben weder ein Problem mit América Móvil, noch sind wir gegen diese Partnerschaft an sich, so Telekom-Betriebsratsvorsitzender Walter Hotz: Unser Problem ist die ÖIAG. Post-Betriebsratschef Köstinger: Wenn man einen Vertrag schließt, in dem man sich selbst zum Juniorpartner macht und im günstigsten Fall da und dort ein Vetorecht eingeräumt bekommt, dann ist das ein schlechter Vertrag. Am 23. April hatten die Arbeitnehmervertreter gegen das Syndikat gestimmt und waren einer Aufsichtsratssitzung aus Protest ferngeblieben. Wir wollten uns an dem Versagen der ÖIAG nicht beteiligen, so Luksch. Laut den Betriebsräten ist die ÖIAG heute eine reine Ausverkaufsgesellschaft, deren Kapitalvertreter die Erfüllungsgehilfen von Finanzminister Michael Spindelegger sind. Bei der Telekom läuft es jetzt in die gleiche Richtung wie seinerzeit bei der AUA, so Köstinger. Die Haltung des Bundeskanzlers stimmt uns sehr nachdenklich, ergänzt Walter Hotz. Er hätte in Machtwort sprechen müssen. Eine so wichtige Entscheidung darf nicht der ÖVP alleine überlassen werden. Die Betriebsräte fordern eine Reform des ÖIAG-Gesetzes.

The third round of the Racing Club International Diamond Drive Cup took the Queens’ Design drivers to the iconic Silverstone Circuit for a long 90 minutes race. With the forecast teasing a bit of rain, the right strategy was essential to achieve success for the team to find themselves on the podium again. The team decided to stop halfway through, opting for a dry setup due to no wind being present forecasting no weather change.Qualifying was a tricky session, and although the conditions never became optimal, the lap times were still very quick. Aenore Rose once again found herself in pole position with a 1:57.790. Mia Rose lined up beside her with a 1:58.407 with Kainé Luna trailing right behind the Roses with a 1:59.017. Ruby Acosta had a tough qualifying session, settling for 6th with a 1:59.300.

Het programma van deze concerten is ontstaan vanuit de gedachte dat het jammer is om muziek, waarop hard is gestudeerd, maar eenmalig uit te voeren. Daarom werd muziek uitgezocht die we graag nog eens wilden zingen, aangevuld met enkele nieuwe werken. De rode draad was dan ook: 'quodlibet', dat 'voor elk wat wils' betekent. Op het programma stonden vier liederen van César Franck uit de bundel 'Zes duetten voor vrouwenkoor en piano', drie liederen van Catharina van Rennes, vier Maria-liederen van Bruckner, Fauré en Rheinberger, Nigra sum van Pablo Casals en tot slot Angyel van Sergei Rachmaninov. Irina Zhynkina begeleidde het koor op de piano. Zij speelde bovendien twee stukken van Liszt en een pianosolo van Rachmaninov.

LA LEGGE sul riconoscimento delle coppie omosessuali in Italia diventa realtà. Il ddl Cirinnà, che il 25 febbraio scorso era stato approvato dal Senato, con il sì della Camera entrerà in vigore definitivamente nel nostro ordinamento. L’iter parlamentare non è stato privo di travagli, tanto che in Senato dal maxiemendamento, presentato dal governo e passato con voto di fiducia, è stata stralciata la parte sulla «stepchild adoption», l’adozione del figlio del partner, su cui puntava il Pd. Sono stati poi eliminati anche alcuni rimandi al Codice civile sul matrimonio come l’obbligo di fedeltà. Richiamati invece gli articoli 2 e 3 della Carta sulle ‘formazioni sociali’ e sull’uguaglianza fra cittadini. Le principali differenze rispetto al matrimonio sono: non c’è previsione esplicita sull’adozione del figlio del partner, non c’è l’obbligo di fedeltà, non ci sono sanzioni per mancata ottemperanza agli obblighi, c’è minor rigore nella separazione (ad esempio è prevista la decisione unilaterale).

Il bullismo non è sempre ovvio. Il bullismo è un abuso pertanto occorre affrontarlo. A volte quando le persone ci urlano contro, o ci minacciano o ci dicono cosa fare, non ci piace etichettarlo come abuso, ma lo è. Una delle definizioni di abuso è trattare un altro con mancanza di rispetto, crudeltà o violenza. Quando uno non rispetta l'altro, questo è solo un abuso chiaro e semplice.

Sure why not. As long as you stick to 2S or 3S you can. I have run de Castle 2200Kv with a VXL. However, the connectors on that ESC are too small and will get hot, it's a matter of time before they break. Also the VXL has a name to develop problems with the Lipo cutoff resulting in early cutoff when your Lipo is still full. Happened to me as well. When you get the chance I would buy a MMP. I run my Neu 1512 with one and the MMP does not get hotter then 30-35 degrees Celcius and the fan doesn't even come on. The VXL however got too hot to touch.

A silhouette is the image of a person, animal, object or scene represented as a solid shape of a single color, usually black, with its edges matching the outline of the subject. The interior of a silhouette is featureless, and the whole is typically presented on a light background, usually white, or none at all. The silhouette differs from an outline, which depicts the edge of an object in a linear form, while a silhouette appears as a solid shape. Silhouette images may be created in any visual artistic media, but were first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed.

Moers. (pst) Einstimmig hat der Hauptausschuss am Mittwoch, 24. Februar, die Haushaltssatzung 2021 der Stadt Moers beschlossen. Das Gremium hat wegen der aktuellen Pandemiebestimmungen anstelle des Rats getagt. Die Stadt Moers rechnet in diesem Jahr mit einem Überschuss von rund 483.000 Euro. Damit ist der Haushalt grundsätzlich genehmigungsfähig. Als nächster Schritt steht die Zustimmung der Aufsichtsbehörde an. In diesem Jahr steht der Haushalt besonders unter dem Einfluss der Corona-Pandemie. Stadtkämmerer Wolfgang Thoenes konnte aber die daraus entstehenden Mehraufwendungen isolieren. Sie können ab 2025 über längstens 50 Jahren abgeschrieben werden. Ebenfalls beschlossen haben die Mitglieder den Stellenplan für dieses Jahr. Aus dem Grund können zwei neue Stellen, die durch kurzfristige Anträge aus dem politischen Raum auf der Tagesordnung standen, vorerst befristet ausgeschrieben werden. Hierüber soll im kommenden Sitzungslauf eingehender diskutiert werden.

Unsere Reise nach Kuba führte uns zunächst mit dem Flieger von Düsseldorf aus in meine Heimat nach Frankfurt, bevor es dann von dort per Direktflug mit Condor in circa 10 Stunden bis in das im Südosten von Kuba gelegene Holguin ging. Trotz meiner zwei Meter Körperlänge war der Flug recht erträglich dank Buchung der nicht wesentlich teureren Premium Economy Klasse und das Essen an Bord war auch in Ordnung. Kaum aus dem Flieger, traf uns auf der Treppe erst einmal frontal und ohne Gnade der "Hitzehammer" mit vollen 34 Grad Außentemperatur, dank der, von so gut wie keinerlei Wolken verdeckten, karibischen Sonne. Aber egal: Hauptsache Sonne, Karibik und vor allem endlich Urlaub! :-) Da außer uns lediglich eine andere Maschine abgefertigt wurde, kamen im recht kleinen Flughafengebäude von Holguin unser Koffer nur wenige Minuten später auf dem Band entlang gerollt und auch die Zollkontrolle, sowie die Mietwagenübernahme bei dem Anbieter Rex verlief recht zügig und unproblematisch.

« Le salon du rez-de-chaussée communique avec les chambres du haut par un escalier dont la rampe est branlante ; on en saute, on en tombe ; on y prend la parole ou son élan vers le lustre. Le premier étage est réservé aux premiers rôles ; c’est l’Olympe, la figuration n’y monte pas. C’est là-haut qu’on fait ses valises, que le clan se réunit, que les mauvais coups se préparent, et les départs en coup de vent. Les chambres donnent accès sur l’extérieur par un escalier de plein air, ou un balcon, une échelle murale, une balustrade qu’il est facile d’escalader d’un bond. Quand on monte dans ce club privé où les femmes décident du drame, quand ce ne sont pas des financiers véreux et leurs nervis, c’est pour décider d’un raid, d’un rapt, d’une expédition punitive, ou prendre le prochain train, le dernier, qui peut être celui du bonheur, si l’on peut s’estimer heureux d’avoir la vie sauve, au sortir de ce qui tient tout à la fois du bar américain, du caf’con’, de la maison de change et de la maison de passe, lieu géométrique des querelles alcoolisées dont le solde sera réglé en décors naturels ou en extérieurs reconstitués. »

The Conservative party remains the longest-established major political party in modern British history. This collection makes available 19th century documents illuminating aspects of Conservatism through a critical period in the party’s history, from 1830 to 1874. It throws light on Conservative ideas, changing policies, party organisation and popular partisan support, showing how Conservatism evolved and responded to domestic and global change. It explores how certain clusters of ideas and beliefs comprised a Conservative view of political action and purposes, often reinforcing the importance of historic institutions such as the Anglican Church, the monarchy and the constitution. It also looks at the ways in which a broadening electorate required the marshalling of Conservative supporters through greater party organisation, and how the Conservative party became the embodiment and expression of durable popular political sentiment. The collection examines how the Conservative party became a body seeking to deliver progress combined with stability.

I work in a flower shop. Other than that, I'm divorced because I want to have sex with hot rabbits. I have no experience with naughty games like group sex or anything else. I want to try these things with a man who has experience. Ideally, I would like the boys who write to me to be brown and preferably handsome. I'm looking for a man who is tireless, because I require a lot from him sexually. I love staying in bed all weekend, if my partner knows how to please me. You can set up a date in an unusual place for this future hookup. Otherwise, I am available mostly at night and on Saturdays. I want to find a man who will be willing to realize all my erotic games. I am looking forward to your replies. I'm looking forward to seeing you, kisses.

After the Planning Commission approved the project, a neighbor appealed the decision to the City Council. The City Council upheld the appeal, finding that the facility was inconsistent with the height of other infrastructure in the neighborhood. Verizon then sued the City in federal court, seeking to invalidate the City’s current ordinance as too restrictive, and asking the court to overturn the City Council’s decision. The case is currently pending.

The Ministry of Health & Wellness informs the public that the pattern of the COVID-19 cases has changed. Currently, the majority of cases present upper airway symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and sore throat associated with a mild fever and/or muscle aches and pains. The cases are increasing exponentially with a leap in the positivity rate from 2.5 to 16 in a very short period of time. While genomic sequencing is pending, epidemiologically, it appears to be the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

Klaus Schaffrath kann man stundenlang zuhören. Er ist kein Patriarch, sondern Unternehmer mit ganzem Herzen. Nicht nur, wenn er aus den Jahren des Wiederaufbaus nach dem Krieg erzählt, als man mit den Papierlieferanten noch bei mitgebrachten Leckereien vom Niederrhein verhandelte, um an den begehrten Rohstoff zu kommen, auf dem ein Drucker drucken kann, oder wenn er von den Jahren des Wirtschaftswunders und Aufstiegs erzählt, sondern weil er für einen klassischen Typ des deutschen Unternehmers aus dem Mittelstand steht und dessen Tugenden wie kaum ein Zweiter repräsentiert. Zupacken, wenn sich Chancen und Innovationen bieten, dafür aber auch immer Maßhalten, operieren mit den Möglichkeiten eines Mittelständlers, nicht übermütig werden und für die Mitarbeiter Sorge tragen. Bei Jan und Martin Schaffrath merkt man deutlich, dass diese Tugenden der Familie Schaffrath, die das Unternehmen seit 1743 prosperieren lassen, ebenfalls tief verankert sind.

Mit einer Membranentgasung wird gezielt freie Kohlensäure oder Sauerstoff dem Wasser entzogen. Membranentgasungsmodule bestehen aus hydrophobe Porenmembranen. Diese sind meist in Hohlfasermodulen aufgebaut. Bedingt durch den Partialdruckgradient diffundiert das Gas durch die Membrane und das Wasser wird Entgast. Zur Erzeugung des Partialdruckgefälles wird je nach Anlagengröße und Leistung ein Strip Gas oder Vakuum mit einem Unterdruckgebläse oder über Pressluft angelegt. Das Funktionsprinzip der Membranentgasung besteht im Wesentlichen darin, dass Luft in einer äußeren Kammer der Module, im Gegenstrom des Wasserflusses in der inneren Kammer, vorbei gezogen wird. Dadurch wird das freie CO2 oder Gas vom Wasserstrom in den Luftstrom gesogen und nach außen transportiert.

Even in a sellers market like PA, it’s smart to look at your options and see what will actually help you best reach your goals with the sale of your house. While you may be able to get a higher “top line” sales price listing with a local Allentown agent, that doesn’t always boil down to more money in your pocket or less headache.

I DO HOPE YOU ALL had a great summer. Travelling across America (see issue 35) was everything I hoped it would be. A highlight was meeting our US readers, some that have been with us for years and others who have just found us and are taking advantage of the lower rates we now offer American subscribers. One of the most memorable parts of my journey was a trek through the Grand Canyon. Americans are justifiably proud of this majestic landscape and of the country’s National Parks. But while I was impressed by these vast areas of untouched wilderness, I thought fondly of Britain’s more domestically scaled landscape, our modest green hills and well-tendered farm land.

Quello di quest’anno è «un Natale tanto atteso, ma anche tanto impegnativo per i tempi difficili che stiamo vivendo: una guerra in Europa, che non ci saremmo mai immaginati, nella martoriata Ucraina, ma anche in varie parti del mondo; i problemi economici, che ci interpellano, per i quali le frange più deboli della popolazione avvertono un forte disagio. Sentiamo il desiderio di sperimentare un clima diverso, di vera fraternità, con un supplemento di gioia e di pace. Tutti ne avvertiamo l’esigenza, ma insieme ci rendiamo conto che la situazione non è promettente. Solo Dio può colmare la distanza che sperimentiamo tra la gioia che cerchiamo e l’inquietudine che ci sovrasta». Queste le parole usate dal Vescovo di Como, cardinale Oscar Cantoni, per introdurre la sua riflessione natalizia dalle colonne de Il Settimanale della diocesi di Como e nel video messaggio che sarà visibile in rete dalle ore 12.00 del 24 dicembre sul canale YouTube della Diocesi di Como. «Vorrei – è l’augurio del pastore della Chiesa di Como – che tutti potessimo toccare con mano la presenza attiva e benefica del Signore che, solo, può allargare il perimetro della fraternità per realizzare in pienezza la nostra capacità d’amare, vocazione a cui è chiamata ogni persona».

In this edition, we’re encouraging you to treat breakfast like the glorious meal it is. Take a moment to start your day off impeccably with our famous Simbithi Eggs Benedict.

1. Carrot, Kuroda Chanteney - This wonderful cool season carrot produces stocky 5-7” carrots with strong tops for easy harvest. They store well in the ground or fridge. You can seed carrots until about ten weeks before your first fall frost without a season extenders like greenhouses. Kuroda matures around 65 days making it an excellent choice for a fall harvest and over wintering. Overwintered carrots are some of the most delicious carrots you will ever have; as the carbohydrates convert into sugars in the cold weather. We can direct seed carrots in our hardiness zone, 9b, until late July.

Having the right Race Horse Insurance coverage is essential. The company will look at your horse’s lineage and value to determine whether it is worth insuring. Some will even consider its training and if it is considered a skilled athlete, it may have a higher replacement value. It will also cover any surgeries and other major medical expenses. You should ask for a policy with a large amount of coverage so that your investment is protected should your horse have an accident or become ill.

Stage two involves watching every "Peanuts" cartoon ever created, including the one where Snoopy hallucinates that the Red Baron is chasing him, causing him to shoot up a convenience store.

Hier sehen Sie den letzten Guthabenstand eines Quittungsbuchs der Stadtsparkasse Dresden, Zweigstelle Pieschen. Genau 6,44 Mark blieben vor 100 Jahren stehen. Was war dieser Betrag wert? Interessant sind in dem Zusammenhang etwa die damaligen Lebensmittelpreise. Das Statistische Jahrbuch für den Freistaat Sachsen 1918/20 bietet auf Seite 283 einige Informationen. Die Weihnachtszeit rückte heran. Angenommen, die Sparkassenkundin hätte Kekse backen wollen, wären wohl die folgenden Preise maßgebend gewesen. So kosteten in Dresden im Kleinhandel ein Pfund Butter 4,36 Mark und ein Hühnerei 1,20 Mark, das Kilo Zucker 1,45 Mark und das Kilo Weizenmehl 84 Pfennige. Falls zu den Keksen ein Glas Milch serviert wurde, schlug der Liter mit 82 Pfennigen zu Buche.

The piece is an attempt to say "goodbye," to cope with the conflicting feelings of an ending, and to be able to say, "That was a good goodbye." This was the first collaboration for Spenser and Jermaine, prompting many new projects and leading to their present collaboration.

Maradona'nın nasıl bir teknik direktör olduğunu sanırım bu turnuvada göreceğiz. Futbolculuğunun önünde diz çöktüren ama herhangi bir teknik adamlık başarısı olmayan bu adamın motivasyonla mı yoksa futbol zekasıyla mı Arjantin'i başarıya götüreceğini merakla bekleyeceğim. Ya da yerin dibine batacaklar, bunu da bekleyip görmek lazım. Ama idman metodları gerçekten ilginç. İdmanlarda Messi'yi falan da bek oynattığı ve bu şekilde bütün takıma ''herkes savunmaya yardım edecek'' felsefesini benimsetmeye çalıştığı söyleniyor. Aslında çok doğru bir metod. Bu takımı belli ki hücum bir yerlere getirecek. Messi, Aguero, Tevez, Milito, Higuain falan. Tarihin görüşmüş en kaliteli hücum rotasyonu. Ama takım oyunu olmadan hepsi hikaye. Bunu da en iyi Maradona biliyor. Kendi zamanında da uçup, kaçtığı dönemlerde ne olursa olsun Arjantin'in iyi bir takımı vardı. Ama o takımda farkı da Maradona yaratıyordu. Şimdi ise yeni Maradona denilen Messi'nin yanında inanılmaz kaliteli isimler de var. Bu futbolcuların fark yaratması doğal ama mutlaka işin savunma kısmında da etkili olmak gerekiyor, belki de Maradona turnuvada bizlere ilginç sürprizler hazırlıyor. Aslında Kuzey Kore'ye falan kapalı kutu diyoruz ama benim için Arjantin daha bi sürprizlere açık takım olacak.

Öncelikle şunu söyleyelim, bir haftaya kalmaz Volkan Şen affedilir. Çünkü bu işin raconu bunun üstünedir, önce kadro dışı bırakırsın, sonrasında da affedersin. Özellikle de bu tip izinsiz yurt dışı seyahati yaptı ve bir gün kampa geç katıldı gibi olaylara da hiç takılmamak gerekiyor. Lincoln'ü hatırlayın, hangi kampa zamanında katıldı. Her kamp döneminde, bir de değil birkaç gün geç geliyordu ve cezasını alıp idmanlara devam ediyordu. Volkan Şen için ise bir anda kadro dışı bıraktık demek ve bunu ses getirici tarzda bir haber yapmak oldukça garip. Mesela ben bu olay karşısında fazla şaşırmadım, sonuçta birkaç güne çözülecek bir durum. Ama bu tip durumlarda genellikle para cezası verilirdi, kadro dışı bırakılma olayı biraz ağır olabilirdi. Zaten Volkan Şen de yaptığının farkında ve cezayı kabullendi, bu sorunun birkaç güne kalmaz çözüleceğini düşünüyorum.

2'de 2 değerli. Galler'in Ermenistan'a kendi sahasında yenilmesi, senin de akabinde Galler'i yenmiş olman ile 2.'liği büyük oranda cebe attın. Galler burada kırıldı, toparlaması zor. 2.'lik de Avrupa Şampiyonası demek. İyi mi oynuyoruz, asla. Hoca ile alakalı sorun var mı, fazlasıyla hem de. Talihli ama Kuntz, makul bir dönemde geldi. Önce Uluslar Kupası'nda bulunduğumuz kategori, sonrasında da Avrupa Şampiyonası eleme grupları. Bu gruptan zaten çıkman gerekiyor, hem de güle oynaya. Gülüyoruz diyemem, iyi oynadığımızı düşünmüyorum. Letonya ve Galler maçları bireysel çabalardı. Letonya karşısında bence kazanmayı hak etmedik. Galler karşısında da, 10 kişilik rakip karşısında çok zorlandık. 2. yarıdaki Barış Alper Yılmaz çabası, Arda Güler / Umut Nayır hamleleriyle maçı çevirdik. Rakibi o kadar açamadık ki, sadece kenar ortalarına kaldık. Umut Nayır, bu tarz oyunda koz işte. Barış Alper Yılmaz ve Ferdi Kadıoğlu soldan sağa geçince, takımın da oyunu değişti. 2 isim de yerini buldu ve sağ kenardan, rakip ceza sahasını daha iyi beslediler. Arda Güler'le de topa hakim oldun, biraz daha ince işler deneyip, fişi çektin. Sahaya çıkan 11'e baktığımda sorun görmemiştim aslında. Bazı performanslar düşük kalıyor, bu da seni hücumda kilitliyor. Barış Alper Yılmaz'ı sırtı dönük değil, yüzü dönük oynatırsan forvet katkısı alırsın. Orta sahanın merkezinden de bana göre hücum katkısı alamadık. Şansımız, Galler'in düşüş dönemine denk gelmek. Değişiyorlar, yeni bir formasyon deniyorlar. Daha rahat kazanabilmek gerekiyordu. Biraz da forvetsizlik bizi etkiliyor. Umut Nayır'ı eleştirdim de, şu 2 maçta gösterdiği çaba yine de takdir edilesi.

Dall'indagine emerge al crescita del numero delle operazioni in cui sono presenti sia i business angels sia i venture capitalist (14 operazioni nel 2012 rispetto alle 9 dell’anno precedente). Stabile invece è l'ammontare nelle operazioni di early stage a 80 milioni di euro (50 milioni di euro dal venture capital, 30 milioni di euro dai business angels), escludendo reinvestimenti e fondi pubblici, e in particolare i business angel riducono il numero delle operazioni ma raddoppiano l’investimento medio che passa dai 180mila euro a 360mila mila euro, si rileva inoltre come il mercato confluisca sempre più verso operazioni di seed capitale.

Crude and slovenly, Dengar was nonetheless an effective bounty hunter. While some hunters prided themselves on finesse and style, Dengar preferred firepower and destruction. Despite his scruffy-looking and battered exterior, Dengar thought highly of himself, enough to make blunt passes at shapely females that caught his eye. Despite these obnoxious qualities, Boba Fett enjoyed working with Dengar and held him in high regard due to his proven track record in hunting down prey.

I first heard his music when I was about 15 or 16, listening to hours and hours of John Peel’s radio show every week, and eager to soak up new ideas about what music could be. In a music lesson at school, Mr McCormick put on ‘Frogs’, and the few of us that were developing an interest in experimental music had our minds well and truly expanded. None of us had heard anything like it, and we all found it – crucially – hilarious. I’ve always found deep comedy in much experimental music: not by laughing ‘at’ it, but just in the absurdity of abstraction, in a Dadaist tradition, I guess… Stockhausen’s Frogs was a high-brow musical version of Monty Python for us, and as a result, hugely compelling and influential.

Pocos imaginan cuÃ¡ntas mujeres forman parte de la historia de la navegaciÃ³n. En los siglos XVI y XVII, seÃ±oras que nunca habÃ­an salido de sus hogares, agarraron el timÃ³n para gobernar pesadas embarcaciones o se subieron a ellas picadas por la curiosidad. Venciendo mil dificultades, se atrevieron a lanzarse a lo desconocido en largas, peligrosas y duras travesÃ­as cubriendo distancias increÃ­bles en mar abierto. Con este nuevo libro, Vicenta MÃ¡rquez de la Plata nos desvela a valerosas seÃ±oras de nuestra historia que Â«dieron la tallaÂ» cruzando el Mar Tenebroso.

Vzniká z únavy, nevyspalosti, úzkosti, rozvíjí se až k bludům a paranoiditě, kterou nelze přehlédnout. Má velmi rychlý proces a u většiny žen, jež jí onemocnění, se dá předvídat.

Överlag ger inkommande information på det hela taget stöd åt ECB-rådets bedömning från det föregående sammanträdet avseende inflationsutsikterna på medellång sikt. Den totala inflationen har sjunkit under de senaste månaderna men underliggande pristryck är fortsatt starkt. Samtidigt påverkar de tidigare räntehöjningarna med kraft de monetära och finansiella förhållandena i euroområdet.

Každý svetelný zdroj je zároveň aj zdrojom tepla.Toto pravidlo platí tak v prírode, ako aj v technike. Duálnu energiu Slnka využívame každodenne bez toho, aby sme si to uvedomili. Technika len ojedinele pozná využívanie generovaného odpadového tepla z umelých svetelných zdrojov. Slnečné žiarenie predstavuje nevyhnutný prírodný zdroj svetla a tepla. Práve tento zdroj energie je pôvodom všetkých dostupných zdrojov obnoviteľnej energie na Zemi. Svetelnú a tepelnú energiu Slnka neustále využíva nielen príroda, ale aj človek. Aj napriek tomu, že veľké množstvo slnečného žiarenia sa rozptyľuje späť do vesmíru, na povrch Zeme dopadá mnohonásobne viac energie, ako je svetová spotreba. Problém však predstavuje periodicita slnečného žiarenia a jej intenzita, ktorá je závislá od počasia. Energetické využitie slnečného žiarenia predstavuje pre človeka a spoločnosť veľkú výzvu. Jediná cesta je premena na uskladniteľnú formu energie. Pri hľadaní tej najvhodnejšej sa môžeme inšpirovať prírodou. Je to fotosyntéza, ktorá predstavuje základný regeneračný proces našej planéty. Kľúčovou činnosťou je preto pestovanie rastlín, ktoré ešte môže zohrať v modernej energetike veľmi dôležitú úlohu.

The poem tells of a father who is an alcoholic. The son is telling the poem of as the recalls his father being an alcoholic and later him understanding everything. Looking at the poem through a formalist approach help show how the positive and negative connotations reflect the young boys torn feeling towards his father. When first reading the poem, I thought that the son loved his father no matter what. My eyes were drawn to the positive connotations such as “but he hung on like death”, which explained how even through the father smelled of whiskey the son

Information vs. instinct. When it comes to investing, many people believe they have a “knack” for choosing good investments. But what exactly is that “knack” based on? The fact is, the choices we make with our assets can be strongly influenced by factors, many of them emotional, that we may not even be aware of.

From super matte to high gloss designs, from subtle to bold textures – release papers add the final look and feel to surfaces. To guarantee a perfect surface finish, we use solvent free polymers for the coating of our release papers, which we combine into a solid and durable surface with the help of electron beam technology (EBT). Depending on the desired effect, we either work with painted, satin finished paper or a film carrier so that our release papers can be used both for gloss and for texture.

TAJUK SURYAKENCANA NEWS, - Stabilitas politik nasional menjadi perhitungan penting bagi kalangan pebisnis, investor, dan perusahaan pers. Politik selalu dimasukkan dalam daftar pertimbangan, sebagai faktor utama. Selain politik, pengelola perusahaan mempertimbangkan faktor lain seperti suku bunga bank, birokrasi layanan yang berbelit, ketersediaan sumber daya manusia, infrastruktur, dan tingkat tekanan serikat buruh di suatu daerah atau negara. Stabilitas politik menjadi pertimbangan utama, karena kekacauan politik bisa menimbulkan kerusuhan yang merugikan banyak pihak, termasuk kalangan pengusaha. Apalagi kalau disertai kekerasan, tindakan barbar, dan bakar-membakar. Siapa yang berani berinvestasi dengan risiko tinggi, dibayang-bayangi kerusuhan politik dan ancaman serikat buruh?

I read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective tales back in the dark ages of the 70s... or was it the 80s? The things that stuck in my head were the snake that came when called (the Speckled Band), the ginormous Lion's Mane jellyfish that was the instrument of murder, and a dog that glowed in the dark. And the clop clop of Hansom cabs through gaslit streets. Sherlock and Watson have been reincarnated multiple times since Sir Arthur wrote those Victorian tales: most recently as Robert (Iron man) Downey Jr. and Jude Law, and Benedict (Smaug, that villain in Star Trek 2, the guy on the black horse in Warhorse) Cumberbatch and Martin (Bilbo, Pirate With a Scarf, BAFTA winner, Arthur Dent) Freeman.

Ce n'est pas déflorer l'intrigue que de le révéler d'emblée, puisque cet événement n'est pas le coeur de cette fiction singulière, déroutante mais entêtante - la première du poète et essayiste Forrest Gander. Cette mort violente est plutôt l'origine du récit : un homme est mort, et ceux qui l'ont connu et aimé parlent de lui - de l'attraction, de la fascination d'essence sexuelle mais aussi intellectuelle qu'il exerça sur eux.

Firstly, your humble writer, who was distracted first by untimely (though much enjoyed) reserve duty, and then quite a heavy workload, failed to convey his profound and (at the time) prophetic commentary on important recent events; Putin and Ukraine, the capture of El Chapo, and so forth. Though we shall hopefully revisit some of these in any event, a good way to get back into rhythm is write about a subject less pressing on the clock. And what better field than the “Voodo” mysteries on the attempts at making a science out of economics. In recent years, an imaginative group often going by “MMTers”, and usually finding the amiable and articulate Mr. Warren Mosler leading their charge, have caused quite a stir, at least among the more thoughtful part of the electorate. Firstly, we must point out that for the most part, proponents of MMT insist that it is not an ideology or even a proponent of any specific economic policy, but rather merely aims to describe the way money works in the modern world; hence Modern Monetary Theory. Specifically, they refer to a fiat currency regime (with the fiat as legal tender, and taxes) with a free-floating exchange rate. [...][Continue Reading...]

The United States may not have any official royals, but you can't get much more distinguished, beloved, and well-known than the iconic Dolly Parton. Among her many impressive accomplishments, Parton changed the country music scene, gifted millions of books to kids around the world, and even helped create one of the COVID-19 vaccines. That's not even counting the awards she's won! To add to all the accolades and honors that Parton has earned over the years, she got invited to have tea with Catherine, Princess of Wales while Parton was visiting London. But sadly, the two famous women didn't get a chance to sit down together on Parton's most recent visit.

Safety talks are often used in organizations to enhance the safety program.

What interested me is that registering arbitrary COM objects as IU can have security consequences, and of course this blog entry didn't mention anything about that.

What I love is to find myself with 2 very naughty types because it makes me all hot to have two penises just for me and my little darling enjoys sharing me. Since we work a lot, we prefer to see you on weekends and at our place or in a swingers club next to Richland. I'm looking for a fun and open-minded guy who will make me come in the company of my husband because I am a naughty girl who loves to have two naughty guys all to herself. Now that you know what I want, you can leave me a message. I'm sure I'll have a good time with you. I'm leaving. Kisses.

My feet ached as I stood on the platform, waiting for the train in Chicago. I was going home to Kansas City after a two-week train trip with eight stops throughout the southeastern U.S. As a travel writer, these trips are often marathons of interviews and a schedule that runs from early morning to late at night. After bouncing from city to city, my reserves were waning. Chicago to Kansas City was the last leg of my trip, and quite simply, I just wanted to get home.

Terms of payment 5.1 Subject to any special terms agreed in Writing between the Buyer and THCL from time to time and if payment is not made on the THCL Portal, THCL may invoice the Buyer for the price of the Goods, Services and/or Products on or at any time after online purchase or delivery of the Goods/Products or performance of the Services (as the case may be), and THCL may deduct without limitation such sums to which it reasonably considers it is due prior to onward transmission of the balance to a Nominated Supplier in the case of transactions completed via the THCL Portal. 5.2 If the Buyer wrongfully or for any reason fails to take delivery of the Goods and/or Products, THCL shall be entitled to invoice the Buyer for the price at any time after THCL has notified the Buyer that the Goods and/or Products are ready for collection or delivery or (at its discretion, retain sums paid without deduction or reimbursement. 5.3 The Buyer otherwise shall pay the price of the Goods, Services and/or Products within 30 days of the date of THCL’s invoice. The time of payment of the price shall be of the essence of the Contract. 5.4 If the Buyer fails to make any payment on the due date then, without limiting any other right or remedy available to THCL, THCL may: 5.4.1 cancel the Contract or suspend any further deliveries of the Goods, Services and/or Products or performance of the Services to the Buyer; 5.4.2 appropriate any payment made by the Buyer to such of the Goods, Services and/or Products supplied under any contract between the Buyer and THCL (or a Nominated Supplier) as THCL may think fit notwithstanding any purported appropriation by the Buyer; 5.4.3 claim interest and/or compensation for reasonable debt recovery costs under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 as amended and supplemented from time to time; 5.4.4 claim the benefit of any liquidated damages provision agreed between THCL and the Buyer; 5.4.5 refuse to make any further delivery of Goods, Products and/or Services without payment in advance; and/or 5.4.6 Suspend (as appropriate) the Buyer’s access to the THCL Portal. 6. Delivery 6.1 Any dates quoted for delivery of the Goods and/or Products, or performance of the Services, are approximate only and THCL shall not be liable for any delay however caused. Time for delivery shall not be of the essence of the Contract unless previously agreed by THCL in Writing. The Goods, Services and/or Products may be delivered by THCL (or a Nominated Supplier, as the case may be) in advance of the quoted delivery date. 6.2 Where the Goods and/or Products are to be delivered in instalments, each delivery shall constitute a separate contract and failure by THCL (or a Nominated Supplier, as the case may be) to deliver any one or more of the instalments in accordance with these Terms or any claim by the Buyer in respect of any one or more instalments shall not entitle the Buyer to treat the Contract, as a whole, as repudiated, or obviate any of the Buyer’s duties and obligations to THCL under these Terms. 6.3 If THCL fails to deliver the Goods, Services and/or Products (or any instalment) for any reason other than any cause beyond THCL’s reasonable control or the Buyer’s fault, or THCL is liable to the Buyer for any other reason whatseover, THCL’s liability shall be limited to sums paid by the Buyer under the Contract. THCL shall, for the avoidance of doubt, incur no liability whatsoever to the Buyer for any failure of a Nominated Supplier or Royal Mail to deliver the Goods, Services and/or Products, or any breach related to such provision. 6.4 If the Buyer fails to take delivery of the Goods and/or Products, or fails to give THCL adequate delivery instructions at the time stated for delivery (other than by reason of any cause beyond the Buyer’s reasonable control or by reason of THCL’s fault) then, without limiting any other right or remedy available to THCL, THCL may: 6.4.1 store the Goods and/or Products until actual delivery and charge the Buyer for the reasonable costs (including insurance) of storage; 6.4.2 sell the Goods and/or Products at the best price readily obtainable and (after deducting all reasonable storage and selling expenses) account to the Buyer for the excess over the price under the Contract or charge the Buyer for any shortfall below the price under the Contract; and/or 6.4.3 Suspend (as appropriate) the Buyer’s access to the THCL Portal. 6.4.4 If and to the extent that Goods and/or Products are being provided by TCHL to Buyers outside the United Kingdom against Buyer order, it is incumbent entirely upon the Buyer to familiarise itself with local customs laws and regulations applying to the offshore delivery of such Goods and/or Products from time to time prior to making an order, and THCL shall not be responsible for any delays/returns of, or damage to, Goods and/or Products as a result of local Customs laws or regulations in force from time to time, which delays, returns and/or damage shall not affect any of TCHL’s rights and entitlements under these Terms. 7. Risk and property 7.1 Risk of damage to or loss of the Goods and/or Products and/or third parties, pets or property shall pass to the Buyer: 7.1.1 in the case of Goods and/or Products to be delivered at the premises of THCL or a Nominated Supplier, at the time when THCL or a Nominated Supplier notifies the Buyer that the Goods and/or Products are available for collection; or 7.1.2 in the case of Goods and/or Products to be delivered otherwise than at the premises of THCL or a Nominated Supplier, at the time of delivery or, if the Buyer wrongfully or unreasonably fails to take delivery of the Goods and/or Products, the time when THCL or a Nominated Supplier / Royal Mail has tendered or attempted delivery of the Goods and/or Products. 7.2 Notwithstanding delivery and the passing of risk in the Goods and/or Products, or any other provision of these Terms, the property in the Goods and/or Products shall not pass to the Buyer until THCL has received in cash or cleared funds payment in full of the price of the Goods and/or Products and all other goods/products agreed to be sold by THCL or a Nominated Supplier to the Buyer for which payment is then due. 7.3 Until such time as the property in the Goods and/or Products passes to the Buyer, the Buyer shall hold the Goods and/or Products as THCL’s fiduciary agent and bailee, and shall keep the Goods and/or Products separate from those of the Buyer and third parties and properly stored, protected and insured and identified as THCL’s property.. 7.4 Until such time as the property in the Goods and/or Products passes to the Buyer (and provided the Goods and/or Products are still in existence and have not been resold), THCL may at any time require the Buyer to deliver up the Goods and/or Products to THCL or its Nominated Supplier (at its discretion) and, if the Buyer fails to do so forthwith, enter on any premises of the Buyer or any third party where the Goods and/or Products are stored and repossess the Goods and/or Products. 7.5 The Buyer shall not be entitled to pledge or in any way charge by way of security for any indebtedness any of the Goods and/or Products which remain the property of THCL or its Nominated Supplier, but if the Buyer does so all moneys owing by the Buyer to THCL shall (without limiting any other right or remedy of THCL) forthwith become due and payable. 7.6Any and all Intellectual Property rights expressly or impliedly disclosed or licenced to the Buyer under this Agreement (whether expressly or impliedly), or produced from, developed or arising as a result of the performance of this Agreement shall remain, or so far as not already vested, become the absolute property of the THCL. The Buyer shall not utilise such Intellectual Property in any unauthorised manner without the prior written consent of THCL, and shall do all that is reasonably necessary to ensure that such rights remain or are vested in THCL by the execution of appropriate instruments or the making of agreements with third parties, should THCL so require. The Buyer shall indemnify THCL, as well as its officers, employees, affliliates, group companies and representatives fully against any and all losses caused to THCL by a breach of this clause 7.6 by the Buyer or any third party as a result of the Buyer’s unauthorised use or disclosure of Intellectual Property. 8. Warranties and liability 8.1 Subject to the following provisions THCL warrants that the Goods and/or Products provided directly by THCL will correspond with their specification at the time of delivery and will be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of 1 month from delivery. 8.2 THCL warrants that it will use reasonable skill and care in performing any Services. 8.3 The above warranties are, however, given by THCL subject to the following specific conditions and exclusions: 8.3.1 THCL shall be under no liability in respect of any defect in the Goods and/or Products or Services of which it could not reasonably have been expected to be aware; 8.3.2 THCL shall be under no liability in respect of any defect arising from fair wear and tear, wilful damage, negligence, abnormal living or working conditions, failure to follow THCL’s or manufacturer’s instructions (whether oral or in Writing), misuse or alteration or repair of the Goods and/or Products without THCL’s approval, or arising from the Buyer’s negligence or breach of their own legal or statutory duties of care for themselves or others; 8.3.3 THCL shall be under no liability under the above warranties (or any other warranty, condition or guarantee) if the total price for the Goods and/or Products or Services has not been paid by the due date for payment; 8.3.4 The above warranty does not extend to any Goods and/or Products (or parts thereof) not manufactured by THCL. 8.5 THCL does not warrant that any Goods, Services and/or Products will be fit for any particular purpose (whether made known to THCL or not). The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for inspecting and testing all Goods and/or Products and for ensuring that the Goods and/or Products are suitable for their particular purposes, but that this will have no impact on its payment obligations to THCL whatsoever. 8.6 Where the Goods and/or Products or Services are sold under a consumer transaction (as defined by the Consumer Transactions (Restrictions on Statements) Order 1976) the statutory rights of the Buyer are not affected by these Terms, unless relevant exceptions are permitted at law. 8.7 Problems based on any defective performance of the Services or defect in the quality or condition of the Goods and/or Products directly purchased from THCL or their failure to correspond with specification, shall (whether or not delivery is refused by the Buyer) be notified in the first instance to THCL within seven days from the date of delivery of the Goods and/or Products or performance of the Services in question or (where the defect or failure was not apparent on reasonable inspection) within a reasonable time after discovery of the defect or failure. 8.8 Where a valid or alleged claim in respect of any of the Goods and/or Products or Services directly purchased from THCL is notified to THCL in accordance with these Terms, THCL may replace the Goods and/or Products (or the part in question) or re-perform the Services free of charge or, at THCL’s sole discretion, refund to the Buyer the price of the Goods and/or Products or Services in question (or a proportionate part of the price), in which case THCL shall have no further liability to the Buyer. THCL shall at its discretion be able to resolve any complaints in any other way it considers reasonable or appropriate in the circumstances, but the Buyer shall indemnify THCL against any and all losses it may suffer whatsoever through the Buyer’s non-compliance with clause 8.7 above prior to further escalation. 8.9 THCL shall not be liable to the Buyer by reason of any representation, or any implied warranty, condition or other term, or any duty at common law, or under the express terms of any Contract, whether express or implied, for loss of profit or for any indirect, special or consequential loss or damage, costs, expenses or other claims for compensation whatsoever (whether caused by the negligence of THCL, its employees, agents, Nominated Suppliers or otherwise) which arise out of or in connection with the supply of the Goods and/or Products or Services (including any delay in supplying or any failure to supply the Goods and/or Products or Services in accordance with the Terms or at all) or their use or resale by the Buyer, and the entire liability of THCL under or in connection with any Goods and/or Products or Services purchased by the Buyer from THCL directly, or from a Nominated Supplier, shall not exceed the price of the Goods and/or Products or Services, except as expressly provided in these Terms. 8.10 THCL shall not be liable to the Buyer or be deemed to be in breach of the Contract by reason of any delay in performing, or any failure to perform, any obligations of THCL or a Nominated Supplier in relation to the Goods and/or Products or Services. 8.11 The Buyer shall be required, at the written request at any time of THCL, to provide or submit to reasonable credit checks. Should, as a result of any such checks (or the Buyer’s failure to provide or submit to such checks), THCL (in its absolute discretion) elect that these Terms should be terminable, then THCL shall be entitled to terminate these Terms on immediate written notice to the Buyer, without prejudice to the right to payment of any sums owing or outstanding as at the date of such termination and/or in respect of costs for work committed to, and without prejudice to any other of its rights under these Terms. 9. Insolvency of Buyer 9.1 This clause 9 applies if: 9.1.1 the Buyer makes a composition or voluntary arrangement with its creditors or (being an individual or firm) becomes bankrupt or (being a company) enters administration or goes into liquidation (otherwise than for the purposes of solvent amalgamation or reconstruction), or a moratorium comes into force in respect of the Buyer (within the meaning of the Insolvency Act 1986); or 9.1.2 an encumbrancer takes possession, or a receiver is appointed, of any of the property or assets of the Buyer; 9.1.3 or the Buyer ceases, or threatens to cease at some point in the future, to carry on business as previously conducted for whatever reason; or 9.1.4 THCL reasonably apprehends that any of the events mentioned above is about to occur in relation to the Buyer and notifies the Buyer accordingly. 9.2 If this clause applies then, without limiting any other right or remedy available to THCL, THCL may cancel the Contract or suspend any further deliveries or performance under the Contract without any liability to the Buyer, and if the Goods and/or Products have been delivered, Services performed but not paid for, or forward supply commitments undertaken by THCL for the purpose of Product, Goods or Services fulfilment, then the price and any THCL liabilities arising as a result of this shall become immediately due and payable on an indemnity basis, notwithstanding any previous agreement or arrangement to the contrary. 10. Confidentiality 10.1 The Buyer shall keep confidential and not (except as authorised or required for the purposes of the Contract) use or disclose to any person or attempt to use or disclose to any person any information (whether or not expressed to be confidential) which it acquires from THCL relating to THCL’s business, business methods, organisation, finances or suppliers, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property. 10.2 The restrictions in clause 10.1 shall not apply to information which the Buyer establishes: 10.2.1 is known to the Buyer at the date of the disclosure by THCL, as evidenced from written records; 10.2.2 is after the date of disclosure by THCL acquired by the Buyer in good faith from an independent third party; and/or 10.2.3 has in its entirety become public knowledge otherwise than in breach of those restrictions. 11.

Die Stadt Mönchengladbach unterstützt die Innovationskraft und das Wachstum der ansässigen Textilwirtschaft durch verschiedene Initiativen und Projekte im Bereich Forschung, Entwicklung und Produktion. Eine entscheidende Triebfeder sind dabei regionale, nationale und internationale Textiltechnik-Startups, die sich im Raum Mönchengladbach gründen, ansiedeln oder international vernetzen und mit der regionalen Forschung und Industrie zusammenarbeiten. Für diese Startups soll eine zentrale Anlauf-, Koordinierungs-, Vermittlungs- und Förderstelle – ein sogenannter Open Innovation Hub – konzipiert und aufgebaut werden. Für diesen Textiltechnik-Startup-Hub wurden im ersten Schritt eine Machbarkeitsanalyse inkl. großer Startup-Umfrage durchgeführt sowie ein Grobkonzept und Realisierungsplan entwickelt.

Hankkeen ”yrittäjäkeskeisyydestä yhteistoimintaan” tavoitteena on siirtyä aiemmasta, omistajayrittäjäkeskeisestä toimintamallista liiketoimintalähtöiseen toimintamalliin, jossa henkilöstön rooli vahvistuu. Se, että vastuuta ja valtaa jaetaan, on edellytys sille, että yritys voi jatkossa luoda edellytykset sujuvan työn tekemiseen ja tarjota hyvän työympäristön nykyiselle ja tuleville työntekijöille. Hankkeen tavoitteena on kehittää organisaation käytäntöjä ja selkeyttää niihin liittyviä vastuita, uudistaa strategiatyötä sekä vahvistaa henkilöstön osallistumista ja vaikutusmahdollisuuksia oman työympäristön suunnittelussa ja toteutuksessa. Näin pyritään saamaan yksilöidenkyvykkyyttä ja osaamista parempaan käyttöön organisaation kaikilla tasoilla. Siirtyminen yrittäjäkeskeisyydestä yhteistoimintaan tarkoitta myös muutoksia toimintakulttuurissa: ensinnäkin se tarkoittaa yrityksen johdonroolin ja tehtävien uudelleen määrittämistä ja vastaavasti yksilöiden ja tiimien toiminnassa siirtymistä kohti vastuullista itseohjautuvaa kaikilla organisaation tasoilla. Osa tätä itseohjautuvauutta on kyky arvioida osaamista suhteessa toimintaympäristöön ja organisaation tavoitteisiin ja toteuttaa esimiehen valmennuksen tuella ja yhteistyössä kollegoiden kanssa.

В очередном докладе компании GitHub State of the Octoverse говорится, что число учетных записей пользователей на сайте GitHub (за исключением фальшивых спамерских записей) дошло до 40 миллионов. Ясно, впрочем, что не все эти пользователи являются разработчиками программ, пишет Computerworld. В GitHub подсчитывают общее число учетных записей, независимо от их активности и участия в разработке проектов, исходные коды которых размещены на сайте. Учетные записи на GitHub создают не только разработчики, но и сотрудники маркетинговых отделов и руководители по продуктам, отмечает обозреватель InfoWorld, а многие разработчики заводят по несколько учетных записей. У GitHub должны быть данные об активности пользователей, но компания не публикует подобных сводных отчетов.

Hollanda'da seksoloji egitimi ve Türkiyede vajinumus ve dısparoni eğitim programına katılarak cinsel sorunların gelişimi ve ortaya çıkma nedenleri konularında bilgi sahibi olduktan sonra, uzun vadeli bir misyon oluşturdum. Günlük seanslarımda bir çok kadın dinliyorum ve bu hikayeler beni ilk öncelikle bir kadın olarak etkiledi ve misyonumu oluşturmaya motive etti. Misyonu oluştururken rol modelim Hz. Aişe olmuştur. Çünkü Hz. Aişe kızların ve kadınların eğitim konusunda en önemli rolü üstlenmiştir. Aynı zamanda erkeklerin eğitim ve öğretim konusunda onlardan merak sahibi ve ve istekli olanları her zaman bilgilendirmiştir. Bu konuyla ilgili bir çok hadisi şerif vardır. Benim misyonum ise, var olan cinsel eşitsizliği duyurmak ve bu eşitsizlik mitler tarafından korunduğunu ifade ederek yazılarımla ve seminerlerimle bu konu hakkında daha fazla konuşmak istiyorum. Hollandalı İmam Abdulwahid van Bommel'in hem fikir olduğum düşüncesini paylaşarak konuya giriş yapmak istiyorum. 'Müslüman bay ve bayan için cinsel eğitim, genellikle mutfak masasında değil, bilgisayar üzerinden yapılır. Konu tabu olarak görülüyor.' Sadece bunun hakkında daha fazla konuşurak bu tabuyu kırabiliriz. Cinsellikle ilgili düşünce ve duygularımızın temelinde ne tür beklenti ve yargılar var? Acaba bu beklenti ve yargılar cinselliğin doğasına uygun mu, yoksa cinsel mitlerle çarpıtılmış mı? sorusu çok can alıcıdır ve kafamızda çözemediğimiz cinsel sorunlarımızı anlamamıza giden önenmli bir yoldur. Cinsel mitler yanlız bizim toplumumuzda değil, bütün dünyada son derece yaygındır. Ancak cinsel mitler, her toplumun kendi kültürel ve sosyal yapısına göre şekillenir. Cinselliğin tabu olarak görülmesi, üzerinde konuşulup tartışılmaması, cinsel mitlerin yaygınlaşmasına sebep olur. Peki, cinsel mitler neden bu kadar önemli? Çünkü cinsel mitler, cinsel sorunlarının oluşmasına nedenlerinden biridir. Cinsel sorunların artarak devam etmesinde önemli rol oynarnalar. Cinsel mitler kişilerin cinsel kimliklerinin oluşmasında önemli yer tutar. Cinsellikle ilığlı abartılı ve gerçekçi olmayan beklentilerin oluşmasına suçluluk ve pişmanlık hislerine, cinsellikle ilgili kaygı vee korkulara neden olarak cinsel işlev bozukluklarına yol açabiliyor. ‘Cinsellik bacaklarımızın arasında değil kulaklarımızın arasındadır ’ demiş Zildberg. Toplumumuzda kadın cinselliği tabu haline gelmiştir. Bundan dolayı kadınlar cinsel bilgi edinmekte zorlanmakta bunun sonucunda da bir çok cinsel sorunla karşı karşıya kalmaktadırlar. Amsterdam Üniversitesi tıp merkezinde Sexoloji profesörü Ellen Laan kadınların cinsellik algısı üzerine yaptığı araştırmalarla dünya çapında tanındı. Araştırmaları, kadınlarda cinsel hazzın özerklik, öz saygı ve benlik saygısı ile ilişkili olduğunu göstermektedir. Bir kadının cinsel özerkliği ne kadar büyük olursa, orgazma o kadar kolay gelir. Kadınların cinsel isteği az değil, cinsel zevki azdır. Bunun açıklamasını Ellen Laan şöyle yapıyor: Sevişirken nadiren orgazm olursanız ya da ağrınız varsa, tekrar yapmak istemediğiniz mantıklıdır. Kadın cinselliğinde temel taşlarından biri klitoristir. Kadınların çoğunun yerini bile bilmediği klitoris, kaşık kemiklerinin birleştiği noktanın ortasındadır. Küçük dudakların yukarıda birleştiği kısma dek uzanır ve büyük dudaklar arasındaki yumuşak dokunun içinde yerleşiktir. Kadınların çoğu cinsel eğitim eksikliği yüzünden cinsel organlarının yapısını bilmezler. Bunun sonucu olarak da cinsel sorunlar yaşarlar. Kadınlarda en sık yaşanan cinsel sorunların başında boşalma ve orgazm sorunları gelir. Aslında kadınlar kendi bedenlerinini tanımadıkları, nelerden hoşlandıklarını bilmedikleri için partnerleri de yönlendiremezler ve bu yüzden de boşalamazlar. Her kadın boşalma yeteneğine sahiptir. Yani kadınların böyle bir yeteneği vardır ama bazı nedenlerden dolayı bu yeteneklerini kullanmayabilirler. Kadınların çoğu genellikle klitoral boşalmayı kolay, vajinal boşalmayı daha zor yaşarlar. Masters ve Johson'ın en çok satan listesinde olan 'Human Sexsual Response' adli kitabına göre: Bir kadın sık klitoral uyarılma ile defalarca boşalma deneyimi yaşabilir. Bunlar ataklar halinde olur. Onlar belirgin doyumlara ulaştırılırsa, bir kadın aldığı zevk neticesinde üç kez boşalma deneyimi yaşayabilir. Kısacası her kadın, kendisine haz alma izni verdiğinde, uygun şekilde ve yeterli süre uyarıldığında boşalabilir. Peki, bu yanlış inanış (mit) 'kadınların cinsel isteği azdır' nasıl oluştu? Kadın cinselliğine yönelik olumsuz düşüncelerden kaynaklanan bu mit, cinselliğin kadın için zevk verici olmaması gerektiğini ve kadının cinselliğinin sadece erkeğe karşı görevi olduğuna yönelik bir inançtan kaynaklanır. Toplumumuzda kız çocuklarını yetiştirirken, onlar için belirlenen roller, bu yanlış inanışın gelişmesine neden olmaktadır. Bu şekilde yetiştirilen bir kadın, kendi cinselliğinden, bedeninden utanacak, yaşacağı hazlardan dolayı suçluluk duyacak ve bunları yaşamak istemediği için cinselliğine çeşitli yollarla engeller getirecektir. İstekli olmayı günah ve ayıp sayan, ancak iç dünyasında dürtüleri doğrultusunda istek duyan kadın, bunları hissettiğinden dolayı suçluluk hislerine kapılabilmektedir. Böylece kendi iç dünyasında karmaşalar yaşayarak bilinçdışı süreçleri ve savuma mekanizmalarının ortaya koyarak, cinsel isteğini baskılamaya çalışacaktır. Kadının isteksizliği nedeniyle erkek de zaman içerisinde eşine karşı uzaklaşma yaşayacaktır. Bir başka yanlış inanış (mit) 'cinsellik penisin vajinaya girmesinden ibarettir'. Türkiye'nin ünlü Psikoterapistlerden biri olan Dr. Cem Keçe bu mitin açıklamasını şöyle özetliyor. Cinsellik ruh, beden ve zihin üçgenininde yaşanılan çok güzel bir süreçtir. Yani cinsellik çok boyutlu bir kavramdır. Bu boyutların eksik bırakılması ile yaşanılan cinsellik, kadın ve erkekte cinsel sağlık sorunlarının ortaya çıkmasına neden olur. Kadınlarda en sık görülen sorunlar uyarılma eksikliği ve boşalma bozukluklarıyken, erkeklerde erken boşalma, iktidarsızlık ve isteksizlik olabilmektedir. Seksi sadece penis vajinaya girmesi ile sınırlayan bu cinsel mit, cinselliğin yanlızca neslin devamına yönelik olması gerektiğine ilişkin bazı tutucu görüşlerle de parelellik gösterir. Bu mit yüzünden kadın ve erkek, yaşları ilerlediğinde paylaşımlarından yoksun kalırlar, birbirlerinden uzaklaşırlar ve cinsel yaşamlarını sonlandırırlar. Oysaki dokunma, sarılma, öpüşme gibi fiziksel temasların, sevgi ve güven duygularının paylaşımı çiftleri birbirine daha çok yaklaştırır ve birliktelikleri sağlıklı olur. Cinsel terapisler olarak, cinsellikle penis-vajina birlikteliğinden ziyade ruhen, bedenen ve zihnen duyguların ve hazların karşılıklı olarak yaşanması gerektiğine inanırız. Cinsel mitler cinsel işlev bozuklukların oluşumunda hem hazırlayıcı hem başlatıcı ve hem de sürdürücü niteliği ile çok önemli yer tutar. İşte bu nedenle de cinsel mitlerin değiştirilmesine ve yerine doğru bilgilerin aktarılması kişilerin cinsel sorunlarının çözümünü katkıda bulunur.

Life is full of its ups and downs. There are times when things are going great and then times where it seems one bad thing after another is hitting you. While this happens to everyone, people respond differently to situations. You may find that someone who is going through a job loss is really struggling to even get out of bed in the morning, while someone who just lost everything in a house fire is still upbeat and cheerful. While it's normal and perfectly OK to feel down and sad when things aren't going great, how you respond to situations can help determine how well you do in life. If you find yourself getting down and depressed every time something even remotely negative happens, you need to evaluate your emotional health. It could be that you are going through depression and need professional help. A doctor can help you feel better, whether it's through prescription medication or perhaps some therapy. However, if you are just a negative person, there are some things you can do to change your perspective.

La prima cosa che devi sapere, prima di iniziare uno studio approfondito è che i poligoni sono ovunque! Un poligono è infatti una qualsiasi forma bidimensionale formata da linee rette.Triangoli, quadrilateri, pentagoni ed esagoni sono tutti esempi di poligoni.Il nome sta ad indicare con precisione quanti lati ha la forma in questione.Ad esempio, un triangolo ha tre lati e un quadrilatero ha quattro lati.Quindi, qualsiasi forma che può essere disegnata collegando tre linee rette è chiamata triangolo, e qualsiasi forma che può essere disegnata collegando quattro linee rette è chiamata quadrilatero. Se la forma presenta delle curve o non si connette completamente, non può essere definita poligono.

Veranstalter des letzten Bewerb der RB Langlauf-Bezirkscupserie war der UNSC Kobenz. Die jungen Nachwuchsathleten der Region fanden die besten Bedingungen, bei diesem Skatingrennen, im Loipenzentrum „Hoftal“ vor. Allein schon die Abwicklung – Massenstart – hatte es in sich und sorgte für spannende Rennverläufe. Großes Lob auch wieder an die Organisatoren, rund um Erich Hochfelner, die für einen perfekten Ablauf sorgten. Besonders die Bambini-Klasse (Jg.2015/2016), hier gab es 7 Starter, war ein Highlight und man sah ihnen die große Freude an, als sie die 500m Runde absolviert hatten. Bei den Mädchen siegte Hannah Gotschacher (Trofaiach) und bei den Buben Viktor Langmaier (Murau) der von einem Missverständnis des bis einige Zentimeter vor der Ziellinie führenden Matheo Prieger (UNSC Kobenz) profitierte. Dieser glaubte bei seinem 1. Rennen schon das Ziel erreicht zu haben und stehen blieb aber er nahm dann das ganz sportlich und hatte auch Riesenfreude mit Rang 2

Los expertos aseguran que estas empresas tienen un importante nicho de mercado y por tanto de negocio, tanto a nivel nacional como europeo. Las EBT basan su actividad en las nuevas tecnologías y en ellas el principal activo es el conocimiento de los socios que la integran. A estas empresas también se les conoce como Startups.

Ice Rockz är en produkt som helt ersätter tobak och andra nikotinfria alternativ som avger rök och smak i samband med att en förbränning äger rum. Produkten används på precis samma sätt som vanlig vattenpiptobak. När produkten hettas upp, frigörs en tjock och mild ånga med intensiv smak. Det kommer att se ut och kännas som vanlig rök när den är som bäst. Den stora skillnaden är att det inte är rök, utan endast en simulering av rök. Ingen förbränning äger rum, så det är inte rök man får i sig, utan endast ånga. Med andra ord så är detta det minst skadliga alternativet av vattenpiprökning.

Ter ere van het Stijljaar in 2017 ontwikkelde het Centraal Museum Utrecht een speciale Rietveld Wandelroute. Deze wandeling voert vanaf het Centraal Museum langs Utrechtse hoogtepunten uit het werk van Gerrit Rietveld (Utrecht 1888 - Utrecht 1964). Dit zijn bijvoorbeeld het geboortehuis van Rietveld, zijn werkplaats, het huizenblok op de Erasmuslaan en natuurlijk het Rietveld Schröderhuis. Naast deze monumenten is ook het Centraal Museum zelf in de route opgenomen. Het museum bezit de grootste collectie Rietveld objecten ter wereld waaronder het Rietveld Schröderhuis. De wandeling voert verder langs highlights in Utrecht zoals de Dom en de Oude Gracht.

“Minha proposta para o projeto M.A.P.A. parte da desconstrução da bandeira do Brasil. Todos elementos presentes nesse outdoor compõem o design da bandeira nacional. Era importante pra mim propor uma bandeira “energizada”, nova, inclusiva. Eliminar o positivismo capenga (“Ordem e Progresso” provêm de “Amor por princípio e a Ordem por base. O Progresso por fim” – portanto faltando o “Amor”) e passível de interpretações autoritárias, reacionárias e elitistas. Minha intenção é focar na energia explosiva, inspiradora, conflitante, libertadora, única, de uma nação formada da diversidade de raças, culturas e orientações sexuais. Uma bandeira que de fato celebre a representatividade e a inclusão e igualdade de todxs. Seguindo essa lógica as cores presentes nesse outdoor são as mesmas na bandeira Progress Pride que mistura as cores da clássica Rainbow Flag com as cores da bandeira do orgulho Trans e duas cores que representam as comunidades de cor LGBTQI+ marginalizadas.”

VMware ESX is tested for compatibility with a variety of major guest operating systems running in virtual machines. Additionally, VMware ESX is tested for compatibility with currently shipping platforms from the major server manufacturers in pre-release testing. Our goal is to support a variety of storage and network adapters used as standard options for these platforms as they come to market. If a specific server, storage array, or device is not listed on the Systems Compatibility Guide, please contact the vendor of that hardware to find out the plans for supporting that hardware with VMware vSphere. vSphere 4.0 requires 64bit hardware. For proper support of the 64bit Guest Operating Systems, necessary virtualization BIOS settings need to be enabled. Please see KB article 1003944 (http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003944)for more information. In addition, many server vendors started implementing some or all VMware specified CIM providers for server manageability. Therefore, health and monitoring information may be incomplete or inaccurate. Please read KB article 1010716 (http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1010716) for more information. If you are having a technical issue with 3rd party HW/SW and it is not found on this list, please refer to our 3rd Party HW/SW support policy at http://www.vmware.com/support/policies/ThirdParty.html. Depopulated Sockets - VMware supports all configurations from 1 socket to N sockets being populated on an N-socket server that is in this Systems Compatibility Guide. The depopulated Server Configuration must have at least 2 physical cores. In addition, the OEM must support the depopulated Server Configuration. All servers are supported in depopulated configuration mode unless noted otherwise via a footnote. Note to VMware System Builder Partners: VMware supports servers listed as available in 'Mother Board' form factor produced by a limited set of VMware Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) server hardware partners that have been certified by the ODM partner for a given ESX release with a fixed set of network and storage I/O devices populated in a reference server system. As such, these server motherboards are listed in this Systems Compatibility guide for informational purposes only to provide a means for OEM partners of this limited set of VMware ODM partners to verify that the complete server systems they build with these server motherboards, and the exact same set of network and storage I/O devices can also be submitted for support by VMware through VMware's Server Certification Equivalency Tool (SCET). VMware works closely with each of its OEMs to drive towards mutual support of ESX at the time of announcement. Due to different product release cycles, levels of testing, and OEM agreements, not all OEM devices will be supported at the general availability date of a new version of ESX. For Intel and AMD processors, VMware supports the processor series and the processor model that are listed with each server. Please check with the server vendor for specific CPU support. RECOMMENDED CPU CLOCK SPEED Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz ESX 3.0.1: * Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz ESX 3.0.2: * Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz ESX 3.0.3: * Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz ESX 3.5: * Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz ESX 3i Embedded: * Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz ESX 3i Installable: * Minimum CPU clock speed - 1500 MHz * Minimum CPU clock speed, Virtual SMP - 1500 MHz VMware Fault Tolerance (FT) is a component of VMware vSphereT that ensures continuous availability for virtual machines against hardware failures.

During the design of the new $68 million Texas A&M Northside Residence Hall, we ensured the building envelope system would achieve optimal performance for several generations of Aggies. After reviewing design submissions at major milestones, recommendations were provided for the brick veneer and glass curtain wall façade that resolved several issues in air and water infiltration. The building is designed to LEED standards with wall insulation up to 25 percent more efficient that the baseline R-value. Frequent visits to the project site during the early stages of building envelope construction focused on all aspects of the building envelope construction, including structural elements and material compatibility.

Sermon Reflections based on Dream Ignition | Alex Hardt | January 7, 2024 ​ HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! The New Year is always a time of reflection about what the year might have in store, goals you might like to see accomplished, and hopes and dreams for all the days that lie ahead. Sometimes we have things we know will take place in the coming year and we want to get ready for them-like a wedding, a baby, a vacation, a move, a new job or as with all of us the unexpected events that will fill the year. How much of your dreaming adds God into the equation? Do you seek His guidance when you are planning the wedding or the vacation, for the new job or when you think a new home is needed? Do you seek His wisdom for dealing with a new child, a new job or a budding relationship? In Pastor Alex’s sermon, he challenges us to dream, and dream big but also to consider God and to include Him when dreaming. He uses Joseph and his situation to show how God reveals and guides.

Essen. (bw) Für die BackWerk Service GmbH verlief das abgelaufene Geschäftsjahr nach eigenen Angaben sehr erfolgreich. Der Außenumsatz aller Niederlassungen wuchs in 2006 um über 60 Prozent auf 50,8 Millionen Euro (2005: 31,8 Millionen Euro). Die Zahl der Verkaufsstellen stieg von 84 auf 122. Der Umsatz der Betriebe, die bereits in 2005 bestanden, stieg um 6,1 Prozent. Demnach entwickelte sich das Essener Unternehmen weiterhin erfolgreich gegen den Branchentrend. In 2006 eröffnete oder übernahm BackWerk 40 neue Geschäfte. In Österreich kam die erste Auslandsfiliale hinzu. Nach der Übernahme der Backfabrik GmbH mit 13 Filialen im Sommer 2006 schloss das Franchise-System zwei Filialen wegen Standortüberschneidungen. BackWerk zählt heute zu den etablierten Franchise-Systemen in Deutschland und arbeitet aktuell mit 100 selbständigen Partnern zusammen. Allein in 2006 wagten über 25 neue Unternehmer mit Hilfe von BackWerk den Sprung in die Selbständigkeit. «Ein durchschnittlicher Betrieb erwirtschaftet nach dem ersten Wirtschaftsjahr 500.000 Euro Jahresnettoumsatz bei einer Umsatzrendite von über zehn Prozent», sagt BackWerk-Geschäftsführer Dr. Dirk Schneider. Im Unternehmen entstehen ständig neue Arbeitsplätze. Die Beschäftigtenzahl in den SB-Filialen stieg 2006 auf 890 gegenüber 610 im Vorjahr. Auch in der Essener Zentrale ist das Wachstum spürbar. Dort wurden acht neue Stellen geschaffen, darunter ein zusätzlicher Ausbildungsplatz. Für 2007 haben sich weitere 25 Unternehmer zur Eröffnung eines BackWerks entschlossen. Der Außenumsatz soll um 40 Prozent auf über 70 Millionen Euro steigen.

I’m done with this cold, rainy nonsense. It’s time for spring, people! I want to see more balmy temps, cool drinks, sundresses, and cherry blossoms. But most of all, I want tequila and tacos because nothing quite puts me in the spirit of warm weather quite like drinking tequila and eating tacos under the sun. So I’m sure you can imagine my feelings towards the opening of El Rey last week, Shaw’s new U Street tacqueria/beer garden. It went sort of like this (only replace “bacon and eggs” with “tequila and tacos”).

Klein, aber oho. So könnte man die gesamte Tiny Epic Serie umschreiben. Als Tiny Epic Kingdoms vor einigen Jahren auf Kickstarter an den Start ging, wagte kaum jemand zu hoffen, was sich daraus entwickeln würde. Bereits die erste Kampagne sammelte Anfang des Jahres 2014 einen Betrag von fast $ 300.000 ein und wurde ein weltweiter Erfolg. Kein Wunder also, dass weitere Teile hintergeschoben wurden, die zum Teil noch mal deutlich mehr Geld eingesammelt haben. Auch ich war damals Feuer und Flamme aufgrund der Idee ein komplettes Spiel auf kleinstem Raum unterzubringen. Ich habe damals sogar Druckvorlagen für Sichtschirme entworfen, da es mich gestört hat, dass man die Ressourcen bei den Kämpfen einsehen konnte. Insgesamt immer noch eine tolle Idee, zumal die unterschiedlichen Teile der Serie auch immer einer anderen Ansatz haben und selten Mechanismen wiederholen. So entwickelte sich ein ganzes Universum aus unterschiedlichen Welten und Spielmechanismen.

To pytanie nie jest wcale pozbawione sensu. Dotąd otworzyć gabinet fizjoterapeutyczny i świadczyć zabiegi mógł tak naprawdę każdy. Zmieni się to od dnia 31 maja 2016 r. kiedy wejdzie w życie ustawa o zawodzie fizjoterapeuty. Zawód fizjoterapeuty będzie samodzielnym zawodem medycznym, a sam tytuł będzie podlegał ochronie prawnej (zob. więcej w artykule nowa ustawa o zawodzie fizjoterapeuty ). Czy to oznacza, że tylko fizjoterapeuta będzie mógł otworzyć gabinet fizjoterapeutyczny? Oczywiście nie, ale tylko fizjoterapeuta będzie mógł wykonywać zabiegi fizjoterapeutyczne. Skomplikowane? Wcale nie - podobnie jest z apteką. Otworzyć może ją każdy ale musi zatrudniać jako kierownika mgr farmacji.

The Herbet Portable Stove’s interlocking tripod design HAS to be one of the most interesting takes on stoves I’ve seen in a while. All it takes to deploy the stovetop is to push the opposite ends together and watch the two tripods expand, creating a stable base as well as a stable stovetop to rest utensils. Made from laser-cut and sheet-folded stainless steel, the Herbet is all about championing portability, with a compact and lightweight design.

The hips, buttocks, and abdomen are areas of the body that are commonly resistant to diet and exercise efforts. Men often choose liposuction to reduce fatty, enlarged breasts. The lower cheeks, jowls and upper and mid neck or “submental” area may also be fuller than one desires from the presence of unwanted fat. Even women and men who lead an active, healthy lifestyle often struggle with isolated pockets of stubborn fat. With liposuction, our Saratoga Springs plastic surgeon, Dr. Steven Yarinsky, can alleviate this frustration and help you attain a more toned and sculpted figure and slimmer face and neckline.

Türkiye Solunum Araştırmaları Derneği (TÜSAD), filtresiz termik santrallere ek süre tanınmasını içeren yasanın Cumhurbaşkanı Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tarafından veto edilmesinin toplum sağlığı açısından önemli bir gelişme olduğunu belirtirken, uyarılarına devam etti. TÜSAD KOAH Çalışma Grubu Başkanı Prof. Dr. Arzu Mirici, özellikle kömürlü termik santrallerin hava kalitesinin bozulmasına neden olduğunu ve solunum sağlığını tehdit ettiğini belirtirken bunun ülke ekonomisi açısından önemli bir maddi kayıp oluşturduğuna da dikkat çekti. Mirici, “Bizim görevimiz halkımızı ve politika yapıcıları bilgilendirmek, TÜSAD olarak bunu yapmaya devam edeceğiz” derken, solunum sağlığı açısından fosil yakıt kullanımının tamamen durdurulması gerektiğini dile getirirdi.

“Design” e “Contemporaneo” sono le ultime opere nate dalla collaborazione artistica tra Friul Mosaic e lo studio Nespoli e Novata, realizzate con lo studio grafico 21.24. Il catalogo Contemporaneo raccoglie composizioni musive dal carattere geometrico, tra cui le linee decise e forti che si scontrano nella nuova creazione Filare. Il catalogo Design è stato ideato con lo scopo di armonizzare tra loro forme e materiali, dove il classico tozzetto quadrato lascia spazio a figure non sempre definibili: listelli, poligoni irregolari, casette, losanghe, trapezi, tutti ottenuti con una lavorazione prevalentemente manuale. Tra queste varie figure troviamo una collezione speciale, la punta di diamante di Friul Mosaic, disegnata proprio da Nespoli e Novara: Gli Elementi. I designer hanno voluto reinterpretare il mosaico artigianale in modo innovativo, utilizzando materiali naturali dalle tonalità cromatiche affini e dai vari formati.

Alles wat je schrijft is je visitekaartje, al is het maar een korte mail. Het bepaalt mede hoe men over jou als professional of collega denkt. Daarom is het goed altijd diegene voor wie je schrijft in gedachten te houden. En het doel dat je wil bereiken bij die persoon. Dat is niet vanzelfsprekend, anders zou je niet zo veel rommelige teksten en vage mails tegen komen. Maar je kan het leren, zoals alles door er bewust mee bezig te zijn. Schrijven bepaalt het beeld van jou, het helpt bij effectief samenwerken. Hoe zorg je ervoor dat je gelezen wordt en je boodschap overkomt?
