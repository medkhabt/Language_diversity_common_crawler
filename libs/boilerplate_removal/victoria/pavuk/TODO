removed without implementing it.
We will appreciate any comments on issues mentioned here or any requests for
new features not mentioned here.

* restart scenario with errors
* reschedule failed URLs
* optionaly allow scan of FTP directories
* add doc titles to tree preview
* support for tunneling HTTP over HTTP proxy using CONNECT request
* checking of Content-MD5: in sync mode (proposed by Mark D. Anderson)
* checking of full path (idea by Tim Small)

* JS for proxy assigning

* add GnuTLS support
* support for -preserve_old (in .old/)

* ftp dir symlinks !

* mode MIRROR does not remove empty directories if they were removed on the
  remote system
* mode MIRROR does not have the same file modification times (local time offset)
* -remove_before_store: does it cover all occasions when a file is modified?

* fix the GTK/X [64-bit] build. (see those #ifdef TODO's for instance)



Win32 port TODO:

* add gettext(Win32) i18n support to the Win32 port of pavuk.

* write up documentation for the new features and changes. (docbook)




Notes [apr/may 2007]:

* read up on autoconf/automake for a more 'modern' gettext
  config approach; see also the AM_GNU_GETTEXT macro in configure.in]

* pid_t handling is a bit convoluted for the native build (see config.h),
  but that's just 5 lines of code in, well, ...

* Look for

    #ifdef TODO

  to find those places which need attention before a GTK/X-based pavuk will
  recompile/run at all.
