2007-april-30 [notes taken from old work back in 2005/2006 merged into pavuk mainstream source tree]

* bufio has seen a MAJOR overhaul. It is now capable of pushing text &
  binary data to the file system at unprecedented rates. This is done by
  adding a variable sized (and possibly large) memory cache, resulting in
  large size I/O operations. These perform very much faster than the regular
  RTL I/O calls. (tested on quad CPU UNIX Dell servers)

  the new bufio was required as I needed to log/track a huge amount of data
  in the shortest possible time / lowest possible CPU load.

* cookie handling has been fixed/augmented. pavuk can now have the initial
  cookie values that go with a certain web request preconfigured on the
  commandline. Also, several bugs in handling the cookies have been fixed.
  (tested on a wicked ASP.NET intranet site which 'assumed' the use of a
  special web client (a TV set top box) which would transmit it's serial #
  as a client-side created(!) cookie to the web server. This site/client
  combo thus actually transmitted cookies which would first show up in a web
  _request_ instead of the usual: a server-side _response_.)

* several portability items have been changed (h_errno, ...) to make the
  code compile and work on the odd-flavored UNIX box. A native Win32 port is
  under way: it now works, inclusing zlib and OpenSSL, though the latter has
  not been tested recently.

  Note that the changes may have broken GTK support, as I was not able to
  build the code with GTK on my UNIX boxes.

* socket I/O (IP traffic) has been fixed to properly cope with user breaks
  (a user hitting Ctrl+C). Several locations in the software where the
  unexpected signal would cause an infinite loop have been identified and
  fixed.

* added several lines of DEBUG_xxx to aid both developer and user in
  tracking down hard to diagnose issues inside pavuk while scanning a site.

* Accepted-Encoding (more specifically: the handling of x-gzip/gzip/x-
  compress/compress encoding) has been changed to allow for better
  portability: data is expanded in-memory, without the need for an external
  'gzip' tool and/or OS-specific forks & pipes.

  (Win32 wouldn't know a fork if ever it saw one.)

* ALL stdio is now handled through the new bufio system. This not only
  improves performance when you've got -debug and -debuglevel dialed all the
  way up, but also corrected several spots where, depending on your C RTL,
  stdio/stderr traffic would arrive at different moments on your console
  (some of it was written through the FILE I/O, some through direct I/O,
  causing blurbs of output to pass one another along the way to the actual
  console).

* buffer overrun protection has been improved. Note also that every
  snprintf() and derivative thereof is now 'augmented' by an additional line
  of code which ensures that the last character in the buffer is guaranteed
  to be a NUL sentinel, thus ensuring that the buffer will always present
  data in correct C string format (NUL-terminated). (This is an old habit of
  mine as some C RTLs have shown to be kinda flaky on the subject of NUL
  sentinels when snprintf() et al are writing data up to the edge of their
  output buffers: some C RTLs 'forget' to put a NUL there under particular
  circumstances (some commercial Watcom compiler releases come to mind).

* multithreading pavuk has been tested on an high perf MP UNIX box and it
  was like the documentation/notes state somewhere: instable. The thread
  interlocking has now been fixed; one of the hardest to fix proved to be
  the lockup at the end of a pavuk run. The fix also includes the use of
  semaphores and some additional code changes to make the code thread safe;
  critical sections are now handled as such. This includes placing several
  non-threadsafe C RTL calls (e.g. ctime()) inside critical sections!

* auto-form-filling (the feature which led me to select pavuk over wget et
  al when I started the hammer/chunky project) has been fixed for those
  special pages where you have an empty form to submit: the site I had to
  test included such a form, which was submitted using javascript, but did
  not contain _any_ input fields (but cookies were expected to come with
  that request, thank you). Before, pavuk crashed on such a page. This has
  now been fixed.

* added a 'reindent' target to the makefile, using GNU indent to reformat
  the code. (When you're working several weeks on end in crunch time, you
  want to see some proper and consistent looking source code, even when you
  just made it a mess yourself...)

  Also extended the cleanup makefile target to help me in cleaning up any
  backup and/or temporary files created by vi and some log diagnostic
  scripts.

  [edit may/2007: wasn't this already in the makefiles before - see
  ChangeLog entry in 2003?]

* added several commandline parameter types, which allow you to instruct
  pavuk to use OS file handles or file names for logging activity, while you
  can now also specify whether a log file should be overwritten (default) or
  appended to (new feature) by adding another '@' prefix to the file path.

  TODO: document this properly.

* added hammer/crunchy modes: several ways to scan a web site and than
  rescan it. The higher (later) hammer mode has been specifically written to
  use pavuk as a 'replay attack' based DoS tool for testing high performance
  web servers. (bufio was overhauled to allow us to log all I/O data +
  diagnostics to disc while hammering the server while the pavuk system
  _must_ perform better (= faster) than the web server when running both on
  equivalent hardware.)

* The native Win32 port has been overhauled (previous code was never
  released to the public) to make sure I did not have to look for OS-
  specific path elements _everywhere_ in the code (it was becomes a code-
  wise maintainance nightmare while fixing up/down all those 'absolute path'
  and 'path expansion' code sections to handle Win32 drive letters (root is
  '[A-Z]:[\\/]' instead of simply '/').

  This has been fixed by using the cygwin 'path hack' for the native Win32
  port too: root is '/cygdrive/[a-z]/' so it looks exactly like a UNIX path.

  Any places in the codes which need to address the OS while passing an OS-
  specific path are now handled almost invisibly: all relevant C RTL calls
  (fopen/open/stat/lstat/symlink/link/unlink/rename/mkdir/rmdir/opendir) are
  now encapsulated in tl_[sysname] wrapper functions where these
  /cygdrive/[x]/ paths are converted back to native Win32 paths before the
  actual C RTL function is called. Also any debug/print statement, which is
  used to report a file path, is fixed to convert file paths to the native
  representation with a minimum of fuss: see the new tl_native() call for a
  description how this was done. This code has not been tested in a UNIX/MP
  environment, but the design is such that this should not cause any trouble
  (pthread port for Win32 is in progress ATM).

* added -debug_level modes: all/trace/dev/bufio/cookie/htmlform. Also added
  a feature where you can now specify a set of debug levels and have some of
  those levels _removed_, e.g. 'all,!dev' will show anything _except_ 'dev'
  level debug output: note the new '!' prefix.

* -debug_level output is now prefixed with its level in caps and square
  brackets, e.g. '[PROCE]' to aid in filtering the debug output (for
  instance by piping it through sed/grep).

* unified debug output handling in the code: -debug_levels are now only
  active when you specify -debug too.

* inflate_decode() and gzip_decode() have been fixed to suit a multithreaded
  environment. gzip_decode() now has an in-memory implementation, using the
  zlib library, for those systems which do not support UNIX pipes/forks.

* Fixed deflate/compress handling: the MJF Accept-Encoding deflate hack has
  been removed and the request header extended. (tested on a Wikipedia
  HTTP/1.1 compliant server)

  You may wish to permanently disable the code within

    #if defined(HAVE_WAITPID) && defined(HAVE_FORK) && defined(HAVE_PIPE)

  in decode.c if you do not wish to depend on the external gzip tool any
  more.

* _all_ system header file #include's have been removed from the sources and
  integrated into config.h to allow for better portable source code.

  config.h.in and autoconf.am have been extended to include several more OS-
  dependent system call and header file checks.

  A seperate native Win32 version of the header file is also provided (used
  by the MSVC2005 native Win32 build).

* several hardcoded buffer sizes in the software have been made configurable
  (but remain hardcoded). See for instance dinfo.c: 12 -->
  PAVUK_INFO_DIRNAME and 1024-and-other-fixed-buf-sizes -->
  BUFIO_ADVISED_READLN_BUFSIZE

* fixed several cases where dangling (i.e. free()d but not NULL-ed) pointers
  caused havok. Code has been quickly reviewed to locate and fix additional
  spots that did not yet cause pavuk to go 'crazy Ivan' (Hunt for the Red
  October, anyone? ;-) )

* hardcoded lock filenames have been converted to #define's to allow these
  to be changed in a single spot (config.h), improving portability. e.g.:

    '._lock' --> PAVUK_LOCK_FILENAME

* UNIX-specific octal privs have been changed to their proper #define's to
  allow for maximum portability (Win32 doesn't know '0644' but can cope with

    S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH

  though maybe in a odd way).

* fixed quite a few spots where an unidentified form encoding method would
  lead to _very_ instable bahaviour, including crashes/core dumps. Look for

    fi->method = FORM_M_UNKNOWN

  assignments and additonal FORM_M_UNKNOWN checks.

* added -no_dns support for those who have to work in an environment with
  flaky or no DNS support (I had to as I was working on a box in a specially
  configured, partially walled-off DMZ zone while developing and testing
  pavuk against a web server.)

* fixed typos in the text as I came along them.

* the bufio overhaul also lead to a overhaul of the -dumpxxx code,
  removing/fixing several spots in the code which caused incorrect/instable
  behaviour. (e.g. code in doc.c)

* Fixed handling of compressed data for any text-based server response;
  pavuk now correctly handles any gzipped/deflated text, including, for
  instance, any 'text/javascript' content sent over the wire in compressed
  form (tested on a Wikipedia-based HTTP/1.1 compliant server).

* added -progress_mode: several choices in progress verbosity.

* added -no_disc_io: test a grab/scan without writing anything to disc.
  Mostly useful in combination with the earlier -hammer modes.

* fixed/updated HTTP error response handling in accordance with RFC2616 so I
  can better see what a HTTP/1.1 compliant target is reporting back to
  pavuk. (errcode.c et al)

* unified timing units to fix a few timing oddities: instead of minutes,
  etc. the code uses seconds everywhere (apart, of course, from the few
  locations where we use milleseconds ;-) )

  -timeout is now in milliseconds!

* Added -rtimeout and -wtimeout command line parameters.
  (unit: milliseocnds)

* added -allow_persistent / -noallow_persistent commandline arguments to
  allow/disallow the use of HTTP/1.1 persistent connections.

* added -dumpcmd and -dumpdir commandline arguments.

* added -bad_content commandline argument for use with the hammer/chunky
  modes.

* added -report_url_on_err commandline argument: report the URL which was
  processed while the error occurred.

* added -test_id commandline argument: this is included in the timing report
  so reports can be better automatically processed / combined.

* added -page_sfx commandline argument to help pavuk identify what suffixes
  are to be considered web pages (useful for scanning ASP and ASP.NET sites
  which present unusual mime types with their pages).

* added -tlogfile4sum commandline argument: specify a log file where timing
  info is stored. Handy when pavuk is not only used to grab the info off a
  site but also scan & report site performance.

* added -encode commandline parameter as the counterpart of -noencode.

* added -nohtDig, -noquiet and -noverbose commandline parameters as
  counterparts of -htDig, -quiet and -verbose respectively.

* added filepath support to -dumpfd and -dump_urlfd: by specifying the
  option prefixed with a '@' character, pavuk will treat the option value as
  filepath specification instead of a OS file handle and subsequently open
  the specific file internally. Note that adding yet another '@' character
  as a prefix signals pavuk to _append_ to the specified file, instead of
  _overwriting_ it.

  This is useful when you wish to have those dumps but are working in an
  environment where you cannot pass valid file handles through the
  commandline.

* added -dump_request and -nodeump_request commandline arguments for use
  with -dumpfd: when -dump_request is specified, the log file will include
  complete dump of each request sent to the server by pavuk. Thus you can
  produce a complete audit trail of the exchange.

* replaced the DUMP_URLLIST macros in stats.c by two functions. Code is a
  bit cleaner that way.

* fixed times.c which barfed on timestamps beyond 2037 (signed int wrap
  around for time_t).

* added assert() checks at several locations in the code to help track down
  unexpected behaviour which could lead to crashes (like it did till now).

* unified the proliferation of HEX2ASC-alike macros with and without off-by-
  one offsets inside. Now there's one macro for each of 'em in tools.h.

* changed the configure.in option to --disable-threads to keep the pattern
  consistent (--disable-xxx series of options in configure), but the default
  behaviour remains the same.

* configure.in: as --disable-debug removes any debug-_related_ features from
  the pavuk build, these options have been added: --disable-debugging will
  create a default build with all debugging removed from the compiled
  binaries. --disable-prof and --disable-gprof have been added to remove any
  profile info from the default compiled binaries.

* added checks in configure.in for socklen_t, pid_t and a bunch of system
  calls and header files that do not live in each environment.



2007-may-6

* included pthreads-Win32 based multithreading support in the native Win32
  build.

* included EXPERIMENTAL tre (regex) support in the native Win32 build.

* fixed several lurking bugs (buffer overruns, etc.) which only showed in a
  multithreaded environment.

* fixed locking bugs in the new bufio implementation.

* added Win32 memory leak + heap checking for the DEBUG build: many memory
  leaks have been tracked and fixed. (MSVC <ctrdbg.h> based)

* fixed memory leak due to wrong scope in report_error() code.

* added DBGxxx macro's to aid heap tracking for the debug build. See
  DBGdecl/DBGpass/DBGvars usage.

* removed a very nasty memleak in html_parser_get_url() which would leak at
  least 3 blocks for each rejected local anchor URL - and those come quite a
  few! Took me a day to track it down. :-(

* added filtering so gzipped/compressed files on the server are not
  decompressed unintentionally while the server supports Accept-
  Encoding:gzip or compress.

  ( doc_download_helper() in doc.c )



2007-may-11

* renamed function should_leave_persistent() to the more appropriately named
  should_keep_persistent()

* Updated 'chunky' source to the state of the latest pavuk CVS contents (as
  of today) as this code has not yet been merged into CVS itself.

* fixed bugs in -scenario handling, when scanrio files produced by pavuk are
  re-used in the Win32 environment

* fixed bugs in path & file type commandline arguments for the native Win32
  port.

* fixed bug in retrying/resuming download for RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1) 'chunked'
  content download handling.

* merged -allow_persistent / -noallow_persistent commandline arguments with
  the equivalent -persistent/-nopersistent feature from the official pavuk
  CVS sources.

  Also improved the code a bit: added the 'Connection: close' header for
  requests over -nopersistent connections, so the server will close the
  connection for us.

* added the -ignore_chunk_bug commandline argument to allow pavuk to handle
  RFC2616 'chunked' downloads from buggy (IIS) web servers.

2007-may/june

* recompiled in 64-bit Linux (SuSe 10.2) and fixed a few items in the
  Makefile.am, configure.in and ac-config.h.in files. Also added the tests\
  and www\ directories to the distro.

* fixed a few 64-bit compile warnings; at least the test cases in tests\
  perform OK now on a 64-bit Linux system.

* updated the man page a bit; still a lot more to do. Where is that 'nroff
  for dummies' cheatsheet when you need it?  ;-(

* listed -use_http11 as 'on' by default now.

* moved MODE_MIRROR unescape code section up in url.c to line 1682 in
  url_get_local_name_real() as this code would otherwise have no effect at
  all in any environment where the '%' percent character is included in the
  FS_UNSAFE_CHARACTERS charset (for example: Win32).

* PARAM_DOUBLE default values are now fixed point values in 'long' integer
  format; the current values in the program (all 0.0) are clearly within
  range _and_ it 'saves' on compiler warnings quite a bit. (We've still some
  way to go before we get anywhere near a '[almost-]zero-warning cross
  platform portable build: few int to pointer and vice versa casts remain.)

* fixed bug in cfg_get_num_params() which would access uninitialized memory
  out there in NirvanaLand when a PARAM_UNSUPPORTED option was passed to
  pavuk.

* Fixed configure.in to include 'debug' build handling for KDevelop (which
  would pass '--enable-debug=full' to ./configure).

* updated the configure.in script to increase portability (opendir/closedir:
  dirent.h et al)

* included a few aufoconf macros in the m4 directory for easier/proper
  portability support using autoconf et al.

* bugs fixed from BUGS list: multithreaded mode is not as stable as single
  threaded (fixed at least for the CLI version of pavuk; the GTK GUI version
  is in a rather bad shape)

* bugs fixed from BUGS list: signal handling / timeout does not really work
  (at least not in multi threaded downloads). After a SIGINT pavuk just
  hangs.) This has also been fixed for the CLI version of pavuk at least.

* Win32 port now includes JavaScript support (using the statically linked
  Mozilla js library).

* fixed short option definitions in options.h: -tp / -tsp et al

* 'fixed' GUI for Javascript enabled builds (GTK2) - WARNING: it compiles
  now, but has NOT been tested, so expect bugs here!

* merged the 'chunky' code with the pavuk main source tree. Now 'chunky' is
  equivalent to building pavuk with './configure --enable-hammer'.

* set default from -leave_site to -dont_leave_site to prevent 'blown up' web
  crawls when this filter parameter has not been specified.

  This change includes a fix for the cfg/command line handling of pavuk for
  the conditions section (see condition.h + config.c) as pavuk assumed
  sizeof(long)==sizeof(int) in these code sections.

* Now the proper GPL license (GPL, not LGPL) is included in the file
  ./COPYING.



2007-sep

* fixed processing of zero byte length files (robot.txt at figleaf.com,
  etc.): no more crash/assertion failure due to NULLed docu->contents.

* fixed a few memleaks.

* added extra error checking for file rename operations as some issues were
  found with the Win32 build when using a SAMBA-shared filesystem for
  storing the spidered data/files. (It turned out that the same issues
  existed when using native (NTFS, FAT32) filesystems.)

* dialed down the number of default threads from 3 to 1 (see BUGS) to
  prevent a hail of (legitimate) rename error reports.

* added flock() implementation for Win32: when built with multithreading
  support, having no valid flock() implementation is very dangerous!

* changed configure.in to detect both flock() and fcntl() file locking
  mechanisms so pavuk will be able to support writing spidered content to
  network shares on both Win32 and UNIX systems: flock() does not support
  network shares locks, fcntl() does, at least on the latest Linux kernels,
  see man flock(2)

* added error reporting/checking for undesirable use of invalid flock()
  implementation. (Useful when porting pavuk to other non-Unix platforms.)

* Fixed content/file size treatment code for items which are already
  available locally (i.e. pavuk finds the item at the remote has not changed
  from when the last time it fetched the item into local cache).

* Fixed the conditions for when to display certain informational messages:
  less screen clutter when not running in '-verbose' mode OR when running in
  '-progress' modes.

* Fixed several error/info messages in the code section for decompressing
  gzip/compress transmitted HTTP content.

* Fixed handling of gzip/compress transmitted content when retrieved from
  local store instead (when pavuk discovers that the file at the remote site
  has not changed since the last time it was fetched and stored on your
  local disc).

* Fixed a few memleaks.

* Changed the DBGvars/DBGpass/DBGargs macros used for tracing memory
  allocations in debug mode to make these macros look more like regular 'C'
  functions to 'demented' code formatters and analysis tools. The drawback
  is that these still look 'weird' in function prototypes, but that causes
  quite a few less errors/warnings than the old style.

* Fixed bugs in get_abs_file_path() directory detection and Win32 abs path
  processing.

  Also fixed code which produced double slashes in file paths on occasion,
  causing trouble on Win32 platforms. (Fix applied generally.)

* Fixed mk_native() allocated string management pool to support printf() et
  al where up to 3 mk_native() calls are made in the argument list. This is
  important to prevent spurious crashes in multithreaded mode when the worst
  case scenario for mk_native() applies: all threads are executing printf()-
  style statement which has multiple calls to mk_native() in the argument
  list.

  Currently overdimensioned a bit as the actual code only has two
  simultaneous calls while the pool now is dimensioned to tolerate 3
  simultaneous calls per thread.

* No more _strfindnchr() and strfindnchr(): strfindnchr() - and its use -
  has now been fixed to match the (proper working) _strfindnchr().
  [fnmatch.c/tools.c et al]

* Fixed const-correctness of several functions.

* Added '-mime_type_file' commandline option to help pavuk support an up-to-
  date list of mime types and their filename extensions, using, for example, 
  the UNIX mime.types(5) config file as a source of MIME type information.

  If the user does not specify the '-mime_type_file' option, the original 
  built-in defaults will be used instead.

  This feature has been added to provide better support for the pavuk -
  fnrules %M macro: this macro now will use this configuration to produce a 
  suitable filename extension for each MIME type: the first extension listed 
  in the '-mime_type_file' config file for the given MIME type will be used 
  as extension for the %M macro.

* Changed the GTK GUI macros to become functions for ease of debugging. The 
  added (tiny) call overhead won't be a performance hit anyway.

* Fixed -fnrules handling: the generated path is cleaned up before it is 
  returned to pavuk for use.

  Cleanup actions:
  - duplicate '/' slashes are removed
  - filenames and directory names which end in a '.' dot, get the dot 
    removed

* Added '%X' to the -fnrules formatted processing to allow reformatting of 
  filenames using an optional mimetype-derived extension. This is useful 
  when grabbing Wiki (MediaWiki et al) sites when you'd like to store the 
  grabbed content using default mimetype-related filename extensions, so 
  instead of storing a file like

    wiki/page/AboutThisSite

  that would transform into

    wiki/page/AboutThisSite.html

  while pages like

    wiki/static_page/contact.htm

  would remain as is.

  (Note: this might be considered shorthand for a -fnrules (...) expression 
   which compares both %e and %E. The intent of %X, however, is to only 
   allow %e extensions to pass which are 'valid' for the given MIME type and 
   force the %E mimetype based extension for all other cases.)

  CAVEAT: %e/%E/%X/%Y will print the extension WITHOUT the leading '.' dot in 
          both simple mode and extended LISP mode.

* Added '%Y', '%A' and '%B' to the -fnrules macros: '%Y' uses the MIME type 
  prefered filename extension if the URL/filename doesn't have an extension 
  yet (while the rather similar '%X' will OVERRIDE the existing extension if 
  it is not listed with the specified MIME type).

  '%B' prints the 'basic MIME type', i.e. the MIME type without the ';' 
  semicolon separated MIME attributes such as language, etc., while '%A' 
  will print these extensions (if they were passed to us by the server).

  CAVEAT: %e/%E/%X/%Y will print the extension WITHOUT the leading '.' dot in 
          both simple mode and extended LISP mode.

  All this allows for pavuk -fnrules commandline arguments like this:

    -fnrules F '*' '%h:%r/%d/%b%s.%Y'
    -mime_types_file ./mime.types
    -tr_chr_chr ':\\!&=?' '_'

  so we'll be able to grab a [Media]Wiki site while storing those pages as 
  regular 'abc_php_xyz.html', instead of 'abc.php?xyz' page/filenames.

* Added -fnrules 'fnseq' operator to the extended rules: compares a 
  wildcard pattern and a string a la fnmatch(3).

* Checked and updated manpage for the -fnrules operators (added 'ud' and 
  'sp' operators to the manpage).

* Added -fnrules 'sn' operator to the extended rules as counterpart of 'ns'.
  'sn' uses strtol() to convert a string to a number, while 'ns' uses printf()
  to format a number to a string. (See the man page.)

* Updated the man page a bit regarding '-fnrules'.

* sanitized escape_str(); a quick code review led us to a lurking bug in uconfig.c@309,
  which has been fixed implicitly.
  
* Added/updates source code documentation: tools.c/tr.c soure code comments.

* Added some sanity checks in the code (tools.c/tr.c/lfname.c)

* Added debug_level 'rules' to allow debugging of both simple and 'extended' -fnrules 
  expressions and '-fnrules' URL F/R matching.
  
* Different boxes exhibit different mktime() behaviour, especially when handling
  out of range tm value sets. Besides, mktime() works in 'local time' while some
  parts of the code require a robust UTC mkgmtime() (not available on many boxes)
  --> ripped & introduced as tl_mkgmtime(). A local time-aware equivalent with
  excellent out-of-range handling is available as tl_mktime().
  
* Added additional error handling around calls which try to parse time stamps using
  tl_mkgmtime() and tl_mktime() (times.c).
  Basically, now both HTTP and FTP benefit from the new code which should now
  proces timestamps like the UTC timestamps they are, while 'out of UNIX time_t bounds'
  timestamps (beyond the range 1970..2038 A.D.) are handled in a more sane manner:

  - out of bounds timestamps are reported by pavuk
  - out of bounds timestamps are then 'sanitized', i.e. restricted to the 
    1/1/1970..31/12/2037 date range, i.e. a timestamp beyond the horizon, like '1/4/2051'
    will be 'sanitized' (= restricted) to the upper bound: 31/12/2037. The same goes for
    a date from antiquity like '11/3/1969' (the birthday of a certain person), which
    will be 'sanitized' towards 1/1/1970.
  
* Split up DEBUG into developer related stuff, such as memory/heap checking, 
  ASSERT/VERIFY, etc. and user related stuff (the -debug and -debug_level command line
  arguments): ./configure is now fitted with an extra parameter:
  
  --enable/disable-debug-features
  
  which will turn on/off -debug/-debug_level user level debugging support in pavuk,
  while the existing
  
  --enable/disable-debug
  
  adds/removes additional developer checks, such as heap allocated checks and ASSERT
  and VERIFY macros.
  
  In the code, -debug/-debug_level related code is located within the 'HAVE_DEBUG_FEATURES'
  sections, while the developer debug/release builds are still related to the standard
  'DEBUG' #define.

  This now results in three ./configure options that determine the (debug) feature set of
  your binary:

  --enable/disable-debugging --> compile a binary with source level debug info included
                                 and all optimizations DISabled for improved debugging
                                 (by using gdb or another debugger of your choice)

  --enable/disable-debug     --> include/exclude additional run time checks in your
                                 binary. Most important are the ASSERT and VERIFY
                                 pre/post-condition validation methods located throughout
                                 the code. The use of these is advised, though these
                                 may cause a performance hit.

  --enable/disable-debug-features 
                             --> include/exclude user level -debug/-debug_level command
                                 line features, which help you as a pavuk user to 'debug'
                                 a run by analyzing the output of pavuk during the run.
                                 Using -debug, pavuk will be EXTREMELY verbose, which can
                                 be toned down by applying a -debug_level restriction 
                                 filter. For example:

                                   -debug -debug_level all,!devel

                                 will be VERY verbose, but will NOT log any DEVEL level
                                 debug info, while:

                                   -debug -debug_level !all,rules

                                 will ONLY produce additional output for the RULES level, i.e.
                                 when pavuk processes -fnrules and/or JavaScript macros.

* Fixed crash when non-RFC compliant website was grabbed: see testcase 7a.

* Added targeted help: when options cannot be parsed correctly, short_usage() will try to
  help the user by printing the full help for the abusing commandline option only.
  (Of course, I screwed up while using debug_level flag sets _again_ :-( [Ger])

* Some improvements for network connectivity error handling and reporting. (xvherror() added.)
  This is the result of some FTP tests with pavuk (tests 8b).
  
* Don't yak about 'Checking "robots.txt"' anymore when doing a FTP grab when robots.txt is 
  NOT applicable anyway.
  
* FTP: added crude 'autodetect/retry' mechanism for FTP servers which do not like NLST
  (==> response code 550) but report correct directory content for LIST (or vice versa).
  (ftp.c)
  
* FTP/HTTP: at debug level 'protoD' pavuk will now dump RAW data/content received from
  the server before preprocessing (i.e. converting to HTML or decompressing).

* Added command line option integer sizing support: byte sizes can now be specified in
  K, M or G. Other integer values can also be postfixed with K, M or G, but then these
  will be treated like the ISO values 1000, 1E6 and 1E9.

* Addition memory leak fixes in case pavuk is fed an invalid commandline.

* NTLM support code: fixed a few glaring bugs.

* Added O_SHORT_LIVED to lock file open() flags for better Win32 behaviour.

* Fixed code to load the pavuk configuration settings from, in order of appearance:

   env:PAVUKRC_FILE
   ~/.pavukrc
   SYSCONFDIR/pavukrc
  
  which matches the description in the manual.
